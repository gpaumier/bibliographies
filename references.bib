  abstract  = {"There was no way moving to Los Angeles was going to make me give up my soul. After all, I'd already seen all the movies about Hollywood. I knew how things worked."Twenty-four year-old Russel Middebrook and his boyfriend have moved to Los Angeles so Russel can try to make it as a screenwriter.Almost right away, in a forgotten old house off of Sunset Boulevard, Russel meets Isaac Brander, a once-famous film producer who is convinced he can turn Russel's screenplay into a movie.Russel knows that success can't possibly come this easy. After all, most of Russel's Los Angeles friends are so desperate to make it that it's downright scary. His ex-boyfriend, Otto, is trying everything to become an actor, and Daniel, the sexy neighbor, doesn't even need a casting couch to get naked.So what's the catch with Mr. Brander? Could it be that movies about Hollywood don't tell the whole truth? But what does that mean for Russel's soul?Barefoot in the City of Broken Dreams, a companion book to Brent Hartinger's The Thing I Didn't Know I Didn't Know, is a fast-paced, funny story about the price of fame in Hollywood: the hilarious lengths people will go to achieve it, and the touching secret to survival when things don't work out exactly as planned.Advance Praise for Barefoot in the City of Broken Dreams:"A sharp, canny, highly engaging tour through a Hollywood of cunning characters and colorful intrigues, guided by the clever voice of Russel Middlebrook as an eager young screenwriter trying to bust in. I was charmed by every sly, sexy page." - Barry Sandler, screenwriter of Making Love and Crimes of Passion"With his trademark wit, warmth, and economy, Brent Hartinger brilliantly captures what it's like to move to L.A. and try and make it in Hollywood: the highs and the lows, the friends and the phonies, the fun and the frustration. And by the way, is it too late for me to be Russel Middlebrook when I grow up?" - Dennis Hensley, co-screenwriter of Testosterone, author of Misadventures in the (213)},

  abstract = {As a major source for information on virtually any topic, Wikipedia serves an important role in public dissemination and consumption of knowledge. As a result, it presents tremendous potential for people to promulgate their own points of view; such efforts may be more subtle than typical vandalism. In this paper, we introduce new behavioral metrics to quantify the level of controversy associated with a particular user: a Controversy Score (C-Score) based on the amount of attention the user focuses on controversial pages, and a Clustered Controversy Score (CC-Score) that also takes into account topical clustering. We show that both these measures are useful for identifying people who try to "push" their points of view, by showing that they are good predictors of which editors get blocked. The metrics can be used to triage potential POV pushers. We apply this idea to a dataset of users who requested promotion to administrator status and easily identify some editors who significantly changed their behavior upon becoming administrators. At the same time, such behavior is not rampant. Those who are promoted to administrator status tend to have more stable behavior than comparable groups of prolific editors. This suggests that the Adminship process works well, and that the Wikipedia community is not overwhelmed by users who become administrators to promote their own points of view.},

However, certain inappropriate behaviors are more threatening than others. In this work, we study contributions which are not simply "undone" but deleted from revision histories and public view. Such treatment is generally reserved for edits which: (1) present a legal liability to the host (e.g., copyright issues, defamation), or (2) present privacy threats to individuals (i.e., contact information). Herein, we analyze one year of Wikipedia's public deletion log and use brute-force strategies to learn about privately handled redactions. This permits insight about the prevalence of deletion, the reasons that induce it, and the extent of end-user exposure to dangerous content. While Wikipedia's approach is generally quite reactive, we find that copyright issues prove most problematic of those behaviors studied.},

  abstract = {This study examines the ways in which information consumers evaluate the quality of content in a collaborative-writing environment, in this case Wikipedia. Sixty-four users were asked to assess the quality of five articles from the Hebrew Wikipedia, to indicate the highest- and lowest-quality article of the five and explain their choices. Participants viewed both the article page, and the article's history page, so that their decision was based both on the article's current content and on its development. The analysis shows that the attributes that most frequently assisted the users in deciding about the quality of the items were not unique to Wikipedia: attributes such as amount of information, satisfaction with content and external links were mentioned frequently, as with other information quality studies on the web. The findings also support the claim that quality is a subjective concept which depends on the user's unique point of view. Attributes such as number of edits and number of unique editors received two contradictory meanings - both few edits/editors and many edits/editors were mentioned as attributes of high-quality articles.},

It contains over 3.7 million pages of content; with many pages written on scientific subject matters that include peer-reviewed citations, yet are written in an accessible manner and generally reflect the consensus opinion of the community. In this, the 19th Annual Database Issue of Nucleic Acids Research, there are 11 articles that describe the use of a wiki in relation to a biological database. In this commentary, we discuss how biological databases can be integrated with Wikipedia, thereby utilising the pre-existing infrastructure, tools and above all, large community of authors (or Wikipedians). The limitations to the content that can be included in Wikipedia are highlighted, with examples drawn from articles found in this issue and other wiki-based resources, indicating why other wiki solutions are necessary. We discuss the merits of using open wikis, like Wikipedia, versus other models, with particular reference to potential vandalism. Finally, we raise the question about the future role of dedicated database biocurators in context of the thousands of crowdsourced, community annotations that are now being stored in wikis.},

  abstract  = {Wikipedia is emerging as the dominant global knowledge repository. Recently, large numbers of Wikipedia users have collaborated to produce more structured information in the online encyclopedia. For example, the information found in tables, categories and infoboxes. Infoboxes contain key-value pairs, manually appended to articles based on the unstructured text therein. The wiki contains some structured information which can be crawled by DBpedia 2, which attempts to organize wiki data into into a database of subject-predicate-object triples. By leveraging this data we generate an interface, which we call WiGipedia, embedded on every Wikipedia article as an interactive graph visualization where entities represent articles, categories and relational entities, with typed edges between them. This intelligent web interface is designed to simplify the elicitation of semantically structured information in Wikipedia (Figure 1). Our motivation is to both inform the user of interesting contextual information pertaining to the current article, and to provide a simple way to introduce and/or repair semantic relations between wiki articles. User actions result in improved accuracy and consistency of structured data spread across multiple articles. WiGipedia provides users with an intuitive interface that allows single-click Wikipedia edits without knowledge of the Wikipedia markup language, templates, etc. An online demo of the interface can be found at www.wigipedia-online.com.},

After an overview of current research on information quality in Wikipedia, a summary of the extended discussion on the quality of encyclopedic entries in general is given. On this basis, a heuristic method for evaluating Wikipedia entries is developed and applied to Wikipedia articles that scored highly in a search engine retrieval effectiveness test and compared with the relevance judgment of jurors. In all search engines tested, Wikipedia results are unanimously judged better by the jurors than other results on the corresponding results position. Relevance judgments often roughly correspond with the results from the heuristic evaluation. Cases in which high relevance judgments are not in accordance with the comparatively low score from the heuristic evaluation are interpreted as an indicator of a high degree of trust in Wikipedia. One of the systemic shortcomings of Wikipedia lies in its necessarily incoherent user model. A further tuning of the suggested criteria catalogue, for instance the different weighing of the supplied criteria, could serve as a starting point for a user model differentiated evaluation of Wikipedia articles. Approved methods of quality evaluation of reference works are applied to Wikipedia articles and integrated with the question of search engine evaluation.},

We argue that the standard transactions costs approach underpinning many extant analyses is an insufficient framework for unpacking the evolutionary character of governance. The evolution of Wikipedia and its shifting modes of governance can be better framed as a process of building a collective capability of editing and managing a new kind of encyclopaedia. By applying cluster analysis we then submit six propositions derived from this framework to a preliminary empirical testing in order to assess the morphological development of Wikipedia.},

DESIGN The authors measured Wikipedia's ranking on general Internet search engines by entering keywords from MedlinePlus, NHS Direct Online, and the National Organization of Rare Diseases as queries into search engine optimization software. We assessed whether article quality influenced this ranking. The authors tested whether traffic to Wikipedia coincided with epidemiological trends and news of emerging health concerns, and how it compares to MedlinePlus. MEASUREMENTS Cumulative incidence and average position of Wikipedia compared to other Web sites among the first 20 results on general Internet search engines (Google, Google UK, Yahoo, and MSN, and page view statistics for selected Wikipedia articles and MedlinePlus pages. RESULTS Wikipedia ranked among the first ten results in 71-85\% of search engines and keywords tested. Wikipedia surpassed MedlinePlus and NHS Direct Online (except for queries from the latter on Google UK), and ranked higher with quality articles. Wikipedia ranked highest for rare diseases, although its incidence in several categories decreased. Page views increased parallel to the occurrence of 20 seasonal disorders and news of three emerging health concerns. Wikipedia articles were viewed more often than MedlinePlus Topic (p = 0.001) but for MedlinePlus Encyclopedia pages, the trend was not significant (p = 0.07-0.10). CONCLUSIONS Based on its search engine ranking and page view statistics, the English Wikipedia is a prominent source of online health information compared to the other online health information providers studied.},

Towards this goal we analyze the process of article creation and communal interaction in different language Wikipedias through the lens of social network analysis. Wikipedia exists in 273 languages (August 31, 2010), among them are languages like Finish, Korean, and Japanese which are not shared by other countries. Therefore Wikipedia offers a kind of microscope to analyze how people in these local cultures work together. As all the Wikipedians in the different languages ultimately share the same objectives and goals, this study is a first step to gain some insights from the editors' behavior on culturally influenced collaboration patterns in the real world. This is based on the premise that the editors reflect their own cultural norms and their way of collaboration in the real world back on the Wikipedia article creation process},

The facets explored are: election participation, decision making in elections, and election outcome. We find that voters tend to participate in elections that their contacts have participated in. Furthermore, there is evidence showing that an individual's decision-making is influenced by his contacts' actions. The properties of voters within the social graph were also studied, results reveal that candidates who gain the support of an influential coalition tend to succeed in elections.},

This growing body of useful, gene-centric content is the result of the work of thousands of individuals throughout the scientific community. Here, we describe recent improvements to the automated system that keeps the structured data presented on Gene Wiki articles in sync with the data from trusted primary databases. We also describe the expanding contents, editors and users of the Gene Wiki. Finally, we introduce a new automated system, called WikiTrust, which can effectively compute the quality of Wikipedia articles, including Gene Wiki articles, at the word level. All articles in the Gene Wiki can be freely accessed and edited at Wikipedia, and additional links and information can be found at the project's Wikipedia portal page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Gene\_Wiki.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, I examine the Articles for Deletion (AfD) system in /Wikipedia/, a large-scale collaborative editing project. Articles in Wikipedia can be nominated for deletion by registered users, who are expected to cite criteria for deletion from the Wikipedia deletion. For example, an article can be nominated for deletion if there are any copyright violations, vandalism, advertising or other spam without relevant content, advertising or other spam without relevant content. Articles whose subject matter does not meet the notability criteria or any other content not suitable for an encyclopedia are also subject to deletion. The AfD page for an article is where Wikipedians (users of Wikipedia) discuss whether an article should be deleted. Articles listed are normally discussed for at least seven days, after which the deletion process proceeds based on community consensus. Then the page may be kept, merged or redirected, transwikied (i.e., copied to another Wikimedia project), renamed/moved to another title, userfied or migrated to a user subpage, or deleted per the deletion policy. Users can vote to keep, delete or merge the nominated article. These votes can be viewed in article's view AfD page. However, this polling does not necessarily determine the outcome of the AfD process; in fact, Wikipedia policy specifically stipulates that a vote tally alone should not be considered sufficient basis for a decision to delete or retain a page. In this research, I apply machine learning methods to determine how the final outcome of an AfD process is affected by factors such as the difference between versions of an article, number of edits, and number of disjoint edits (according to some contiguity constraints). My goal is to predict the outcome of an AfD by analyzing the AfD page and editing history of the article. The technical objectives are to extract features from the AfD discussion and version history, as reflected in the edit history page, that reflect factors such as those discussed above, can be tested for relevance, and provide a basis for inductive generalization over past AfDs. Applications of such feature analysis include prediction and recommendation, with the performance goal of improving the precision and recall of AfD outcome prediction.},

  abstract = {Wikipedia stands as an undeniable success in online participation and collaboration. However, previous attempts at studying collaboration within Wikipedia have focused on simple metrics like rigor (i.e., the number of revisions in an article's revision history) and diversity (i.e., the number of authors that have contributed to a given article) or have made generalizations about collaboration within Wikipedia based upon the content validity of a few select articles. By looking more closely at metrics associated with each extant Wikipedia article (N=3,427,236) along with all revisions (N=225,226,370), this study attempts to understand what collaboration within Wikipedia actually looks like under the surface. Findings suggest that typical Wikipedia articles are not rigorous, in a collaborative sense, and do not reflect much diversity in the construction of content and macro–structural writing, leading to the conclusion that most articles in Wikipedia are not reflective of the collaborative efforts of the community but, rather, represent the work of relatively few contributors.},

The study is based on the analysis of the log lines registered by the Wikimedia Foundation Squid servers after having sent the appropriate content in response to users' requests. The analysis has been conducted regarding the ten most visited editions of Wikipedia and has involved more than 14,000 million log lines corresponding to the traffic of the entire year 2009. The conducted methodology has mainly consisted in the parsing and filtering of users' requests according to the study directives. As a result, relevant information fields have been finally stored in a database for persistence and further characterization. In this way, we, first, assessed, whether the traffic to Wikipedia could serve as a reliable estimator of the overall traffic to all the Wikimedia Foundation projects. Our subsequent analysis of the temporal evolutions corresponding to the different types of requests to Wikipedia revealed interesting differences and similarities among them that can be related to the users' attention to the Encyclopedia. In addition, we have performed separated characterizations of each Wikipedia edition to compare their respective evolutions over time.},

  abstract  = {Researchers have used Wikipedia data to identify a wide range of antecedents to success in collective production. But we have not yet inquired whether collective production creates those public goods which bring most value-add from a social perspective. In this poster I explore two key circumstances in which collective production can fail to respond to social need: when goods fail to attain high quality despite (1) high demand or (2) explicit designation by producers as highly important. In the context of Wikipedia. I propose first to examine articles that remain low quality, or underproduced, despite the fact they are viewed often; and second, to examine articles that remain low quality despite the fact that they were identified as important by Wikipedia contributors. This research highlights the fact that collective production needs to be examined not only by itself but also in the context of a market for goods in order to ascertain the benefits of this production form. The final version of this study will integrate data on underproduced articles with data on knowledge categories to uncover systematic patterns of underproduction at the category level and predict which categories are most in need of quality improvement. Additionally I will use in-depth qualitative methods to examine the mechanisms through which underproduction occurs in select knowledge categories to distill practical recommendations for collective production improvement.},

Despite the apparent lack of order, the 50 million edits by 4.8 millioncontributors to the 1.5 million articles in the English-languageWikipedia follow strong certain overall regularities. We show that the accretion of edits to an article is de- scribed by a simple stochastic mechanism, resulting in a heavy tail of highly visible articles with a large number of edits. We also demonstrate a crucial cor- relation between article quality and number of edits, which validatesWikipedia as a successful collaborative effort. 1},

  title    = {W7 model of provenance and its use in the context of {Wikipedia}},
  school   = {THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA},
  year     = {2011},
  abstract = {Data provenance refers to the lineage or pedigree of data, including information such as its origin and key events that affect it over the course of its lifecycle. In recent years, provenance has become increasingly important as more and more people are using data that they themselves did not generate. Tracking data provenance helps ensure that data provided by many different providers and sources can be trusted and used appropriately. Data provenance also has several other critical uses, including data quality assessment, generating data replication recipes, data security management, etc. One of the major objectives of our research is to investigate the semantics or meaning of data provenance. We describe a generic ontology of data provenance called the W7 model that represents the semantics of data provenance. Formalized in the conceptual graph formalism, the W7 model represents provenance as a combination of seven interconnected elements including "what," "when," "where," "how," "who," "which" and "why." The W7 model is designed to be general and comprehensive enough to cover a broad range of provenance-related vocabularies. However, the W7 model alone, no matter how comprehensive it is, is insufficient for capturing all domain-specific provenance requirements. We hence present a novel approach to developing domain ontologies of provenance. This approach relies on various conceptual graph mechanisms, including schema definitions and canonical formation rules, and enables us to easily adapt and extend the W7 model to develop domain ontologies of provenance. The W7 model for data provenance has been widely adopted and adapted for use within Raytheon Missile Systems and the iPlant Collaborative, as well as the US Army's ATRAP IV (Asymmetric Threat Response and Analysis Program) system. We also developed a domain ontology of provenance for Wikipedia based on the W7 model. This domain ontology enables us to extract provenance for each Wikipedia article. We present a study in which we use their provenance to assess the quality of Wikipedia articles. Assessing and guaranteeing data quality has become a critical concern that, to a large extent, determines the future success and survival of Wikipedia since the quality of Wikipedia has been continuously called into question due to various incidents of vandalism and misinformation since its launch in 2001. Our study shows that the quality of Wikipedia articles depends not only on the different types of contributors but also on how they collaborate. We identify a number of contributor roles based on the provenance. Based on the roles and provenance, our research identifies several collaboration patterns that are preferable or detrimental for data quality, thus providing insights for designing tools and mechanisms to improve Wikipedia article quality.},

The top 88 results were classified by level of threat to test security; 19\% posed a direct threat. The authors also found Web sites authored by psychologists that divulged sensitive Rorschach information. In the second study, 588 comments to online news stories covering the Rorschach-Wikipedia debate were coded as expressing favorable or unfavorable opinions regarding the field of psychology, psychologists, and the Rorschach. Eight percent of comments described unfavorable opinions toward psychology, 15\% contained unfavorable opinions toward psychologists, and 35\% portrayed unfavorable opinions of the Rorschach. Common themes and popular misconceptions of the Rorschach contained in these comments are described. Implications and recommendations for practice are discussed. Limitations, including the second study's narrow sample and self-selection bias, are also detailed.},

  abstract = {In their 2005 study, Adamic and Glance coined the memorable phrase "divided they blog", referring to a trend of cyberbalkanization in the political blogosphere, with liberal and conservative blogs tending to link to other blogs with a similar political slant, and not to one another. As political discussion and activity increasingly moves online, the power of framing political discourses is shifting from mass media to social media. Continued examination of political interactions online is critical, and we extend this line of research by examining the activities of political users within the Wikipedia community. First, we examined how users in Wikipedia choose to display (or not to display) their political affiliation. Next, we more closely examined the patterns of cross-party interaction and community participation among those users proclaiming a political affiliation. In contrast to previous analyses of other social media, we did not find strong trends indicating a preference to interact with members of the same political party within the Wikipedia community. Our results indicate that users who proclaim their political affiliation within the community tend to proclaim their identity as a "Wikipedian" even more loudly. It seems that the shared identity of "being Wikipedian" may be strong enough to triumph over other potentially divisive facets of personal identity, such as political affiliation.},

The hypothesis is that pages with significant contributions from authoritative contributors are likely to be high-quality pages. Contributions are quantified using edit longevity measures and contributor authoritativeness is scored using centrality metrics in either the Wikipedia talk or co-author networks. The results suggest that it is useful to take into account the contributor authoritativeness when assessing the information quality of Wikipedia content. The percentile visualization of the quality scores provides some insights about the anomalous articles, and can be used to help Wikipedia editors to identify Start and Stub articles that are of relatively good quality.},

When given a probabilistic transition structure, they are one of the most common methods for description and prediction of symbolic time-series in the biological and social sciences. Here we show how a generalization of a central result for finite-state machines, the pumping lemma, to the probabilistic case, leads to a crucial constraint: sufficiently long sequences will be exponentially suppressed for finite-state processes. We apply the probabilistic pumping lemma to an analysis of behavioral patterns in the distributed, open-source Wikipedia community to demonstrate strong evidence for the emergence of functional powers over and above the regular grammars, and provide evidence to associate these with fundamentally interpersonal and social phenomena.},

  journal  = {ArXiV},

  month    = mar,
  abstract = {In growing numbers, scholars are integrating social media tools like blogs, Twitter, and Mendeley into their professional communications. The online, public nature of these tools exposes and reifies scholarly processes once hidden and ephemeral. Metrics based on this activities could inform broader, faster measures of impact, complementing traditional citation metrics. This study explores the properties of these social media-based metrics or "altmetrics", sampling 24,331 articles published by the Public Library of Science. We find that that different indicators vary greatly in activity. Around 5\% of sampled articles are cited in Wikipedia, while close to 80\% have been included in at least one Mendeley library. There is, however, an encouraging diversity; a quarter of articles have nonzero data from five or more different sources. Correlation and factor analysis suggest citation and altmetrics indicators track related but distinct impacts, with neither able to describe the complete picture of scholarly use alone. There are moderate correlations between Mendeley and Web of Science citation, but many altmetric indicators seem to measure impact mostly orthogonal to citation. Articles cluster in ways that suggest five different impact "flavors", capturing impacts of different types on different audiences; for instance, some articles may be heavily read and saved by scholars but seldom cited. Together, these findings encourage more research into altmetrics as complements to traditional citation measures.},

This search led to 370 articles, of which 50 were selected for review, including 15 adoption surveys. The definition of social media is evolving rapidly; the authors define it broadly to include social networks and group-curated reference sites such as Wikipedia. Facebook accounts are very common among health science students (64-96\%) and less so for professional clinicians (13-47\%). Adoption rates have increased sharply in the past 4 years. Wikipedia is widely used as a reference tool. Attempts at incorporating social media into clinical training have met with mixed success. Posting of unprofessional content and breaches of patient confidentiality, especially by students, are not uncommon and have prompted calls for social media guidelines.},

  abstract = {Part diary, part scientific record, biological field notebooks often contain details necessary to understanding the location and environmental conditions existent during collecting events. Despite their clear value for (and recent use in) global change studies, the text-mining outputs from field notebooks have been idiosyncratic to specific research projects, and impossible to discover or re-use. Best practices and workflows for digitization, transcription, extraction, and integration with other sources are nascent or non-existent. In this paper, we demonstrate a workflow to generate structured outputs while also maintaining links to the original texts. The first step in this workflow was to place already digitized and transcribed field notebooks from the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History founder, Junius Henderson, on Wikisource, an open text transcription platform. Next, we created Wikisource templates to document places, dates, and taxa to facilitate annotation and wiki-linking. We then requested help from the public, through social media tools, to take advantage of volunteer efforts and energy. After three notebooks were fully annotated, content was converted into XML and annotations were extracted and cross-walked into Darwin Core compliant record sets. Finally, these recordsets were vetted, to provide valid taxon names, via a process we call "taxonomic referencing." The result is identification and mobilization of 1,068 observations from three of Henderson's thirteen notebooks and a publishable Darwin Core record set for use in other analyses. Although challenges remain, this work demonstrates a feasible approach to unlock observations from field notebooks that enhances their discovery and interoperability without losing the narrative context from which those observations are drawn."Compose your notes as if you were writing a letter to someone a century in the future."Perrine and Patton (2011).},

  abstract = {Much work has been done on extracting taxonomies from Wikipedia. After reviewing previous work, we find that the previous evaluations do not give a clear sense of the systems' recall. In order to enable a more thorough evaluation, we design an algorithm to generate category subgraphs that are rooted at 10 selected categories from near the top of Wikipedia. The category subgraphs preserve the distribution of the original descendant categories and articles as much as possible by generating random paths in the Wikipedia category graphs that start at the root category and end with a random descendant article. With the exception of the root node in the 10 subgraphs, each node is manually annotated for is-a and instance-of relations with respect to its parent as well as the root node. The newly created datasets enable a more consistent evaluation of taxonomy mining systems. We also propose a set of relation extraction systems which are designed for two major types of relations: flat relations (node-to-root relations) and hierarchical relations (node-to-parent relations). The taxonomic relation extraction systems are trained and evaluated on the new datasets, exploiting the structure of Wikipedia through a rich set of features. The evaluation on the new datasets gives a clear sense of both the systems' recall and precision. Thus, in a 10 fold cross validation experiment, we obtain a precision of 89.5\% and recall of 88.2\% on the task of flat relation extraction. A similar evaluation for hierarchical relation extraction results in a precision of 91.9\%, at a recall level of 95.0\%.},

Then, we extract a minimal spanning tree, using Chu-Liu \& Edmonds' algorithm. We define a notion of stratified tfidf where the stratas, for a given Wikipedia page and a given term, are the classical tfidf and categorical tfidfs of the term in the ancestor categories of the page (ancestors in the sense of the minimal spanning tree). Our method is based on this stratified tfidf, which adds extra weight to terms that "survive" when climbing up the category tree. We evaluate our method by a text classification on the WikiNews corpus: it increases precision by 18\%. Finally, we provide hints for future research},

Other articles that its collaborators work on also influences the quality of an information artifact, creating an interdependent network of artifacts and contributors. Finally, we see evidence of a recursive relationship between information quality and contributor activity, but that this recursive relationship attenuates over time.},

We develop a definition of entropy that can be used to analyze the efficiency of the system as a whole, and relate it to the evolution of power-law distributions and a metric of quality. The concept is applied to the analysis of eight years of Wikipedia editing data and results show that (1) Wikipedia has become more efficient during its evolution and (2) the entropy-based efficiency metric has high correlation with observed readership of Wikipedia pages.},

To describe the rise, persistence, and resolution of such conflicts we devise an extended opinion dynamics model where agents with different opinions perform a single task to make a consensual product. As a function of the convergence parameter describing the influence of the product on the agents, the model shows spontaneous symmetry breaking of the final consensus opinion represented by the medium. For the case when agents are replaced with new ones at a certain rate, a transition from mainly consensus to a perpetual conflict occurs, which is in qualitative agreement with the scenarios observed in Wikipedia.},

Its rapid success has inspired hundreds of scholars from various disciplines to study its content, communication and community dynamics from various perspectives. This article presents a protocol for conducting a systematic mapping (a broad-based literature review) of scholarly research on Wikipedia. The purpose of this review is to analyze particular trends in research and offer the basic groundwork for future studies. We identify what research has been conducted; what research questions have been asked, and which have been answered and which remain unanswered; and what theories and methodologies have been employed to study Wikipedia. This protocol follows the systematic literature review methodology to conduct a systematic mapping study. The review process is work in progress, and has thus far identified over 2,000 studies.This working paper is a rough first draft combining three different working papers by the authors. In its current form, it mainly serves as a placeholder to provide a source for attribution for the website http://wikilit.referata.com, which presents the papers analyzed in the systematic part of this review.

Based on our previously established algorithm, we build up samples of controversial and peaceful articles and analyze the temporal characteristics of the activity in these samples. On short time scales, we show that there is a clear correspondence between conflict and burstiness of activity patterns, and that memory effects play an important role in controversies. On long time scales, we identify three distinct developmental patterns for the overall behavior of the articles. We are able to distinguish cases eventually leading to consensus from those cases where a compromise is far from achievable. Finally, we analyze discussion networks and conclude that edit wars are mainly fought by few editors only.},

  abstract = {Understanding social interaction within groups is key to analyzing online communities. Most current work focuses on structural properties: who talks to whom, and how such interactions form larger network structures. The interactions themselves, however, generally take place in the form of natural language — either spoken or written — and one could reasonably suppose that signals manifested in language might also provide information about roles, status, and other aspects of the group's dynamics. To date, however, finding such domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge. Here, we show that in group discussions power differentials between participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting from this observation, we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power — including a more "static" form of power based on status differences, and a more "situational" form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Using this framework, we study how conversational behavior can reveal power relationships in two very different settings: discussions among Wikipedians and arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court.},

Some studies published by Nature proved that the scientific entries in Wikipedia are of good quality comparable to those in the Encyclopedia Britannica which are mainly maintained by experts. But the manual partition of the articles in Wikipedia from a WikiProject implies that high-quality articles are usually reached grade by grade via being repeatedly revised. So many work address to automatically measuring the article quality in Wikipedia based on some assumption of the relationship between the article quality and contributors' reputations, view behaviors, article status, inter-article link, or so on. In this paper, a lexical clue based measuring method is proposed to assess article quality in Wikipedia. The method is inspired the idea that the good articles have more regular statistic features on lexical usage than the primary ones due to the more revise by more people. We select 8 lexical features derived from the statistic on word usages in articles as the factors that can reflect article quality in Wikipedia. A decision tree is trained based on the lexical clue model. Using the decision tree, our experiments on a well-labeled collection of 200 Wikipedia articles shows that our method has more than 83\% precise and recall.},

Monetary incentives were used to increase motivation to dissimulate. Initial results indicated that participants given the Wikipedia article produced a lower number of responses (R) and had higher scores on Populars, X+\%, XA\%, and WDA\% as compared to controls. However, post-hoc analyses revealed that when the influence of Populars was controlled, significant differences for X+\%, XA\%, and WDA\% disappeared. No significant differences were found for Form\%, Zf, Blends, or PER, although post-hoc analyses controlling for differences in R revealed a significant difference between groups on Zf\%.

  abstract = {Wikipedia is increasingly used as a platform for collaborative data curation, but its current technical implementation has significant limitations that hinder its use in biocuration applications. Specifically, while editors can easily link between two articles in Wikipedia to indicate a relationship, there is no way to indicate the nature of that relationship in a way that is computationally accessible to the system or to external developers. For example, in addition to noting a relationship between a gene and a disease, it would be useful to differentiate the cases where genetic mutation or altered expression causes the disease. Here, we introduce a straightforward method that allows Wikipedia editors to embed computable semantic relations directly in the context of current Wikipedia articles. In addition, we demonstrate two novel applications enabled by the presence of these new relationships. The first is a dynamically generated information box that can be rendered on all semantically enhanced Wikipedia articles. The second is a prototype gene annotation system that draws its content from the gene-centric articles on Wikipedia and exposes the new semantic relationships to enable previously impossible, user-defined queries.

We try to address the issue of language complexity empirically by comparing the simple English Wikipedia (Simple) to comparable samples of the main English Wikipedia (Main). Simple is supposed to use a more simplified language with a limited vocabulary, and editors are explicitly requested to follow this guideline, yet in practice the vocabulary richness of both samples are at the same level. Detailed analysis of longer units (n-grams of words and part of speech tags) shows that the language of Simple is less complex than that of Main primarily due to the use of shorter sentences, as opposed to drastically simplified syntax or vocabulary. Comparing the two language varieties by the Gunning readability index supports this conclusion. We also report on the topical dependence of language complexity, that is, that the language is more advanced in conceptual articles compared to person-based (biographical) and object-based articles. Finally, we investigate the relation between conflict and language complexity by analyzing the content of the talk pages associated to controversial and peacefully developing articles, concluding that controversy has the effect of reducing language complexity.},

  abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (IVR) typically generates the illusion in participants that they are in the displayed virtual scene where they can experience and interact in events as if they were really happening. Teleoperator (TO) systems place people at a remote physical destination embodied as a robotic device, and where typically participants have the sensation of being at the destination, with the ability to interact with entities there. In this paper, we show how to combine IVR and TO to allow a new class of application. The participant in the IVR is represented in the destination by a physical robot (TO) and simultaneously the remote place and entities within it are represented to the participant in the IVR. Hence, the IVR participant has a normal virtual reality experience, but where his or her actions and behaviour control the remote robot and can therefore have physical consequences. Here, we show how such a system can be deployed to allow a human and a rat to operate together, but the human interacting with the rat on a human scale, and the rat interacting with the human on the rat scale. The human is represented in a rat arena by a small robot that is slaved to the human's movements, whereas the tracked rat is represented to the human in the virtual reality by a humanoid avatar. We describe the system and also a study that was designed to test whether humans can successfully play a game with the rat. The results show that the system functioned well and that the humans were able to interact with the rat to fulfil the tasks of the game. This system opens up the possibility of new applications in the life sciences involving participant observation of and interaction with animals but at human scale.},

One of the natural application of this would be prediction of the society's reaction to a new product in the sense of popularity and adoption rate. However, bridging between "real time monitoring" and "early predicting" remains as a big challenge. Here, we report on an endeavor to build a minimalistic predictive model for the financial success of movies based on collective activity data of online users. We show that the popularity of a movie could be predicted well in advance by measuring and analyzing the activity level of editors and viewers of the corresponding entry to the movie in Wikipedia, the well-known online encyclopedia.},

Therefore different models have tried to assess credibility evaluation. Research on another construct, namely attitude certainty has shown that it is influenced by perceived evaluation duration of either familiar or unfamiliar topics. This study investigates whether the duration of the search also influences the trust judgment of Wikipedia articles with either familiar or unfamiliar topics. In the experiment, participants were asked to perform an information seeking task and to rate their trust in the articles. Analysis reveals that the duration of the search does not have impact on the trust judgment, whereas familiarity does.},

As wikis are increasingly adopted in contexts like business, education, research, government, and the public, how to improve user contribution becomes an important concern for researchers and practitioners. In this research, we focus on the quality aspect of user contribution: contribution value. Building upon the critical mass theory and research on editing activities in wikis, this study investigates whether user interests and resources can increase contribution value for different types of users. We develop our research model and empirically test it using survey method and content analysis method in Wikipedia. The results demonstrate that (1) for users who emphasize substantive edits, depth of interests and depth of resources play more influential roles in affecting contribution value; and (2) for users who focus on non-substantive edits, breadth of interests and breadth of resources are more important in increasing contribution value. The findings suggest that contribution value develops in different patterns for two types of users. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed.},

Recent research has shown that the English Wikipedia community has constructed a vast and accurate information resource primarily through the monumental effort of a relatively small number of active, volunteer editors. Beyond Wikipedia’s active editor community is a substantially larger pool of potential participants: readers. In this paper we describe a set of field experiments using the Article Feedback Tool, a system designed to elicit lightweight contributions from Wikipedia’s readers. Through the lens of social learning theory and comparisons to related work in open bug tracking software, we evaluate the costs and benefits of the expanded participation model and show both qualitatively and quantitatively that peripheral contributors add value to an open collaboration community as long as the cost of identifying low quality contributions remains low.},

  abstract = {Although chronobiology is of growing interest to scientists, physicians, and the general public, access to recent discoveries and historical perspectives is limited. Wikipedia is an online, user-written encyclopedia that could enhance public access to current understanding in chronobiology. However, Wikipedia is lacking important information and is not universally trusted. Here, 46 students in a university course edited Wikipedia to enhance public access to important discoveries in chronobiology. Students worked for an average of 9 h each to evaluate the primary literature and available Wikipedia information, nominated sites for editing, and, after voting, edited the 15 Wikipedia pages they determined to be highest priorities. This assignment (http://www.nslc.wustl.edu/courses/Bio4030/wikipedia\_project.html) was easy to implement, required relatively short time commitments from the professor and students, and had measurable impacts on Wikipedia and the students. Students created 3 new Wikipedia sites, edited 12 additional sites, and cited 347 peer-reviewed articles. The targeted sites all became top hits in online search engines. Because their writing was and will be read by a worldwide audience, students found the experience rewarding. Students reported significantly increased comfort with reading, critiquing, and summarizing primary literature and benefited from seeing their work edited by other scientists and editors of Wikipedia. We conclude that, in a short project, students can assist in making chronobiology widely accessible and learn from the editorial process.},

Not so, however, in the case of Wikipedia, in which the proposal to introduce a system of review for new edits (in order to counter vandalism) led to heated discussions. This debate is analysed, and arguments of both supporters and opponents (of English, German and French tongue) are extracted from Wikipedian archives. In order to better understand this division of the minds, an analogy is drawn with theories of bureaucracy as developed for real-life organizations. From these it transpires that bureaucratic rules may be perceived as springing from either a control logic or an enabling logic. In Wikipedia, then, both perceptions were at work, depending on the underlying views of participants. Wikipedians either rejected the proposed scheme (because it is antithetical to their conception of Wikipedia as a community) or endorsed it (because it is consonant with their conception of Wikipedia as an organization with clearly defined boundaries). Are other open-content communities susceptible to the same kind of ‘essential contestation’?},

As its articles can be authored and edited by anyone worldwide, the credibility of the medical content of Wikipedia has been openly questioned. Wikipedia medical articles have also been criticized as too advanced for the general public. This study assesses the comprehensiveness, reliability, and readability of nephrology articles on Wikipedia. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related problems, 10th Edition (ICD-10) diagnostic codes for nephrology (N00–N29.8) were used as a topic list to investigate the English Wikipedia database. Comprehensiveness was assessed by the proportion of ICD-10 codes that had corresponding articles. Reliability was measured by both the number of references per article and proportion of references from substantiated sources. Finally, readability was assessed using three validated indices (Flesch-Kincaid grade level, Automated readability index, and Flesch reading ease). Nephrology articles on Wikipedia were relatively comprehensive, with 70.5\% of ICD-10 codes being represented. The articles were fairly reliable, with 7.1 ± 9.8 (mean ± SD) references per article, of which 59.7 ± 35.0\% were substantiated references. Finally, all three readability indices determined that nephrology articles are written at a college level. Wikipedia is a comprehensive and fairly reliable medical resource for nephrology patients that is written at a college reading level. Accessibility of this information for the general public may be improved by hosting it at alternative Wikipedias targeted at a lower reading level, such as the Simple English Wikipedia.},

Collaborators on breaking news articles rapidly synthesize content to produce timely information in spite of steep coordination demands. Wikipedia’s coverage of breaking news events thus presents a case to test theories about how open collaborations coordinate complex, time-sensitive, and knowledge-intensive work in the absence of central authority, stable membership, clear roles, or reliable information. Using the revision history from Wikipedia articles about over 3,000 breaking news events, we investigate the structure of interactions between editors and articles. Because breaking article collaborations unfold more rapidly and involve more editors than most Wikipedia articles, they potentially regenerate prior forms of organizing. We analyze whether the structures of breaking and nonbreaking article networks are (a) similarly structured over time, (b) exhibit features of organizational regeneration, and (c) have similar collaboration dynamics over time. Breaking and nonbreaking article exhibit similarities in their structural characteristics over the long run, and there is less evidence of organizational regeneration on breaking articles than nonbreaking articles. However, breaking articles emerge into well-connected collaborations more rapidly than nonbreaking articles, suggesting early contributors play a crucial role in supporting these high-tempo collaborations.},

Wikipedia’s unusual policy, ignore all rules (IAR), serves as this tension release mechanism. IAR supports individual agency when positions taken by participants might conflict with those reflected in established rules. Hypotheses are tested with Wikipedia data regarding individual agency, bureaucratic processes, and IAR invocation during the content exclusion process. Findings indicate that in Wikipedia each utterance matters in deliberations, rules matter in deliberations, and IAR citation magnifies individual influence but also reinforces bureaucracy.},

Such multilingual users may serve an important function in diffusing information across different language editions of the project, and prior work has suggested this could reduce the level of self-focus bias in each edition. This study finds multilingual users are much more active than their single-edition (monolingual) counterparts. They are found in all language editions, but smaller-sized editions with fewer users have a higher percentage of multilingual users than larger-sized editions. About a quarter of multilingual users always edit the same articles in multiple languages, while just over 40\% of multilingual users edit different articles in different languages. When non-English users do edit a second language edition, that edition is most frequently English. Nonetheless, several regional and linguistic cross-editing patterns are also present.},

Large scale collections of these socially generated footprints, often known as big data, could help us to re-investigate different aspects of our social collective behaviour in a quantitative framework. In this contribution we discuss one such possibility: the monitoring and predicting of popularity dynamics of candidates and parties through the analysis of socially generated transactional data on the web during electoral campaigns. We focus on two data streams, Wikipedia page views and Google search queries, and discuss issues related to data collection, data cleaning, data analysis as well as the expressiveness and representativeness of the data; we also present popularity dynamics from real case examples of recent elections in three different countries.},

  title     = {How we found a million style and grammar errors in the {English} {Wikipedia}},
  abstract  = {anguageTool is an Open Source proofreading tool developed to detect errors that a common spell checker cannot find, including grammar and style issues. The talk shows how we run LanguageTool on Wikipedia texts, finding many errors (as well as a lot of false alarms). Errors are detected by searching for error patterns that can be specified in XML, making LanguageTool easily extensible.

LanguageTool exists since 2003, and it now contains almost 1000 patterns to detect errors in English texts. These patterns are a lot like regular expressions, only that they can, for example, also refer to the words' part-of-speech. The fact that all patterns are independent of each other makes adding more patterns easy. I'll explain the XML syntax of the rules and how more complicated errors, for which the XML syntax is not powerful enough, can be detected by writing Java code.

Running LanguageTool on a random 20,000 article subset of the English Wikipedia led to 37,000 errors being detected. However, many of these errors are false alarms, either because of problems with the Wikipedia syntax or because the LanguageTool error patterns are too strict. So we manually looked at 200 of the errors, finding that 29 of the 200 errors were real errors. Projected to the whole Wikipedia (currently at 4.3 million articles), that's about 1.1 million real errors - and that does not even count simple typos that could be detected by a spell checker. If you want less errors in your Wikipedia: LanguageTool offers a web-based tool to send corrections directly to Wikipedia with just a few clicks. And while these numbers refer to the English Wikipedia, LanguageTool also supports German, French, Polish, and many other languages.

This talk will contain lots of examples of errors that can be detected automatically, and others that can't. I'll also explain that LanguageTool itself is just a core written in Java (and available on Maven Central), but that it also comes with several front-ends: a stand-alone user interface, add-ons for LibreOffice/OpenOffice and Firefox and an embedded HTTP server.},

Our results characterize the effects of different feedback types, and suggest trade-offs in the effects of feedback between the focal task and general motivation, as well as differences in how newcomers and experienced editors respond to peer feedback. This research provides insights into the mechanisms underlying peer feedback in online communities and practical guidance to design more effective peer feedback systems.},

Human knowledge is nowadays increasingly created and curated online, in a collaborative and highly dynamic fashion. The knowledge thus created is interlinked in nature, and an important open task is to understand its temporal evolution. In this paper, we study the underlying mechanisms of changes in knowledge networks which are of structural nature, i.e., which are a direct result of a knowledge network's structure. Concretely, we ask whether the appearance and disappearance of interconnections between concepts (items of a knowledge base) can be predicted using information about the network formed by these interconnections. In contrast to related work on this problem, we take into account the disappearance of links in our study, to account for the fact that the evolution of collaborative knowledge bases includes a high proportion of removals and reverts. We perform an empirical study on the best-known and largest collaborative knowledge base, Wikipedia, and show that traditional indicators of structural change used in the link analysis literature can be classified into four classes, which we show to indicate growth, decay, stability and instability of links. We finally use these methods to identify the underlying reasons for individual additions and removals of knowledge links.},

Behavioral research describes 3 conflict types: task-related, affective, and process. Affective and process conflicts have been consistently found to impede group performance; however, the effect of task conflict is inconsistent. We propose that these inconclusive results are due to underspecification of the task conflict construct, and focus on the transition phase where task-related disagreements escalate into affective and process conflict. We define these transitional phases as distinct constructs—task-affective and task-process conflict—and develop a theoretical model that explains how the various task-related conflict constructs, together with the composition of the wiki editor group, determine the quality of the collaboratively authored wiki article. Our empirical study of 96 Wikipedia articles involved multiple data-collection methods, including analysis of Wikipedia system logs, manual content analysis of articles' discussion pages, and a comprehensive assessment of articles' quality using the Delphi method. Our results show that when group members' disagreements—originally task related—escalate into personal attacks or hinge on procedure, these disagreements impede group performance. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

It becomes a reality when individuals simply conform to the majority opinion and hesitate to suggest their own solutions to a problem. Anonymity has long been established to have an effect on conformity, but no previous research has explored the effects of different anonymity states in relation to an individual's likelihood to conform. Through a survey of randomly chosen participants from the English-language Wikipedia community, I explored the effects of anonymity on the likelihood of conforming to group opinion. In addition, I differentiated between actual states of anonymity and individuals' perceptions of anonymity. His findings indicate that although people perceive anonymity differently depending on their anonymity state, different states of anonymity do not have a strong effect on the likelihood of conforming to group opinion. Based on this evidence, I make recommendations for software engineers who have a direct hand in the design of online community platforms.},

  abstract   = {Dictionaries are the main reference works for our understanding of language. They are used by humans and likewise by computational methods. So far, the compilation of dictionaries has almost exclusively been the profession of expert lexicographers. The ease of collaboration on the Web and the rising initiatives of collecting open-licensed knowledge, such as in Wikipedia, caused a new type of dictionary that is voluntarily created by large communities of Web users. This collaborative construction approach presents a new paradigm for lexicography that poses new research questions to dictionary research on the one hand and provides a very valuable knowledge source for natural language processing applications on the other hand. The subject of our research is Wiktionary, which is currently the largest collaboratively constructed dictionary project.

In the first part of this thesis, we study Wiktionary from the metalexicographic perspective. Metalexicography is the scientific study of lexicography including the analysis and criticism of dictionaries and lexicographic processes. To this end, we discuss three contributions related to this area of research: (i) We first provide a detailed analysis of Wiktionary and its various language editions and dictionary structures. (ii) We then analyze the collaborative construction process of Wiktionary. Our results show that the traditional phases of the lexicographic process do not apply well to Wiktionary, which is why we propose a novel process description that is based on the frequent and continual revision and discussion of the dictionary articles and the lexicographic instructions. (iii) We perform a large-scale quantitative comparison of Wiktionary and a number of other dictionaries regarding the covered languages, lexical entries, word senses, pragmatic labels, lexical relations, and translations. We conclude the metalexicographic perspective by finding that the collaborative Wiktionary is not an appropriate replacement for expert-built dictionaries due to its inconsistencies, quality flaws, one-fits-all-approach, and strong dependence on expert-built dictionaries. However, Wiktionary's rapid and continual growth, its high coverage of languages, newly coined words, domain-specific vocabulary and non-standard language varieties, as well as the kind of evidence based on the authors' intuition provide promising opportunities for both lexicography and natural language processing. In particular, we find that Wiktionary and expert-built wordnets and thesauri contain largely complementary entries.

In the second part of the thesis, we study Wiktionary from the natural language processing perspective with the aim of making available its linguistic knowledge for computational applications. Such applications require vast amounts of structured data with high quality. Expert-built resources have been found to suffer from insufficient coverage and high construction and maintenance cost, whereas fully automatic extraction from corpora or the Web often yields resources of limited quality. Collaboratively built encyclopedias present a viable solution, but do not cover well linguistically oriented knowledge as it is found in dictionaries. That is why we propose extracting linguistic knowledge from Wiktionary, which we achieve by the following three main contributions: (i) We propose the novel multilingual ontology OntoWiktionary that is created by extracting and harmonizing the weakly structured dictionary articles in Wiktionary. A particular challenge in this process is the ambiguity of semantic relations and translations, which we resolve by automatic word sense disambiguation methods. (ii) We automatically align Wiktionary with WordNet 3.0 at the word sense level. The largely complementary information from the two dictionaries yields an aligned resource with higher coverage and an enriched representation of word senses. (iii) We represent Wiktionary according to the ISO standard Lexical Markup Framework, which we adapt to the peculiarities of collaborative dictionaries. This standardized representation is of great importance for fostering the interoperability of resources and hence the dissemination of Wiktionary-based research. To this end, our work presents a foundational step towards the large-scale integrated resource UBY, which facilitates a unified access to a number of standardized dictionaries by means of a shared web interface for human users and an application programming interface for natural language processing applications. A user can, in particular, switch between and combine information from Wiktionary and other dictionaries without completely changing the software.

Our final resource and the accompanying datasets and software are publicly available and can be employed for multiple different natural language processing applications. It particularly fills the gap between the small expert-built wordnets and the large amount of encyclopedic knowledge from Wikipedia. We provide a survey of previous works utilizing Wiktionary, and we exemplify the usefulness of our work in two case studies on measuring verb similarity and detecting cross-lingual marketing blunders, which make use of our Wiktionary-based resource and the results of our metalexicographic study. We conclude the thesis by emphasizing the usefulness of collaborative dictionaries when being combined with expert-built resources, which bears much unused potential.},

  abstract = {Low molecular weight gelators are molecules that self-assemble to form entangled fibers that entrap solvent through surface tension and capillary forces. The greatest challenge is to design new gelators for specific applications because the impact of structural features on gel formation is unknown. This thesis describes our efforts towards designing new gelator scaffolds via the traditional methods of synthesis and gel screening, and new methods based on computational studies.
Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and characterization of aryl trihydroxyborate sodium salt gelators, serendipitously found to form gels in aromatic solvents. We discovered an unusual dependence of the critical gelation concentration on alkyl chain length, highlighting that a number of interactions drive gel formation. 
Chapter 3 describes the development of computational models to predict gelation ability. Molecular mechanics was used to compare dissolution enthalpies of gelators and nongelators, which were previously shown to be different.  Several models were developed, including modeling interactions as a liquid, this did not reproduce experimental observations, suggesting that solid-state interactions that are important in gelation. 
Chapter 4 describes the synthesis of polymers that disassemble when the end-group is released by an analyte. Several attempts at synthesizing monomers with gelation abilities are described. Overall, these efforts illustrate the challenges of modifying an existing scaffold into a gelator as structural features on gel formation are largely unknown. 
Chapter 5 presents the design, modification, and implementation of a class project based on editing Wikipedia. Through informal open-response surveys and retrospective panel surveys, the students’ responses indicated that teaching with Wikipedia is and effective method for students to explore advanced topics and learn how to communicate science to a diverse audience. 
Chapter 6 describes an extension of the original project for use in undergraduate chemistry courses. Analysis on student expectations of learning reveled that the scope of the project, was too broad for the students to recognize the learning goals. Student-led organization centered on editing Wikipedia was developed to keep new editors contributing longer than the average new editor. This is the first example of the development of an internal organization to formally introduce students to Wikipedia’s editing infrastructure.},

Many Wikipedia pages pertain to academic papers, scholars and topics providing a rich ecology for scholarly uses. Scholarly references and mentions on Wikipedia may thus shape the "societal impact" of a certain scholarly communication item, but it is not clear whether they shape actual "academic impact". In this paper we compare the impact of papers, scholars, and topics according to two different measures, namely scholarly citations and Wikipedia mentions. Our results show that academic and Wikipedia impact are positively correlated. Papers, authors, and topics that are mentioned on Wikipedia have higher academic impact than those are not mentioned. Our findings validate the hypothesis that Wikipedia can help assess the impact of scholarly publications and underpin relevance indicators for scholarly retrieval or recommendation systems.},

The theory of bounded rationality and the heuristic-systematic model serve as the basis of this study. Data were collected employing a quasi-experiment and a web survey at a large public university in the Midwestern United States in the fall of 2011. The study participants consisted of undergraduate students from nine courses whose instructors agreed to their participation. A total of 142 students participated in the study, of which a total of 138 surveys were useable. The major findings of this study include the following: a peripheral cue and knowledge influenced the credibility judgments of college students concerning Wikipedia. The effect of a peripheral cue on credibility judgments was not different between those with high versus low knowledge. Finally, perceived credibility was positively related to heuristic processing, but knowledge, cognitive workload or involvement in a topic was not. This study suggests that educators and librarians need to integrate heuristic approaches into their literacy programs, guiding students to effectively use and not blindly accept cues. Wikipedia needs to offer noticeable cues that can help Wikipedia readers assess the credibility of information. The role of perceptions in heuristic processing needs further investigation. Further, this study demonstrates the strength of a peripheral cue on credibility judgments, suggesting that further research is needed when cues lead to effective credibility judgments and when cues lead to biased credibility judgments. Finally, this study provides the suggestion of an integrated model of the theory of bounded rationality and the heuristic-systematic model that can enhance our understanding of heuristics in relation to credibility judgments.},

  note       = {The ascendency of identity as an effective political mobilization strategy has opened significant opportunities for group definition (or redefinition) of previously accepted information and knowledge claims. The emergence of “identity politics” in this postindustrial era is but one of several reflective conditions, but certainly one that is imminently helpful in understanding the “reopening” of debate on Whitman’s sexual orientation. In order to gain control over definitions it becomes necessary to rhetorically politicize the authority of scholars and the primacy of existing professional knowledge. The struggle over historicity, facilitated by the expansion of telecommunications technologies and online collaboration, has created a substantial opportunity to challenge seemingly “settled” knowledge and expand debate beyond academic boundaries while either appealing to academic authority, or dismissing claims of academic objectivity whenever rhetorically convenient. The decline of traditional authority structures and the opening of discursive opportunities creates a field in which academic expertise becomes increasingly contested for politico-personal ends, especially on a quasi-authoritative, semi-anonymous, open-access forum like Wikipedia. Whitman’s “multitudes,” coupled with his notoriety and claims to be the nation’s poet, make him a rich battleground over American sexual politics.},

  abstract   = {We have developed an application called Wikipedia Live Monitor that monitors article edits on different language versions of Wikipedia, as they happen in realtime. Wikipedia articles in different languages are highly interlinked. For example, the English article en:2013\_Russian\_meteor\_event on the topic of the February 15 meteoroid that exploded over the region of Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia, is interlinked with the Russian article on the same topic. As we monitor multiple language versions of Wikipedia in parallel, we can exploit this fact to detect concurrent edit spikes of Wikipedia articles covering the same topics, both in only one, and in different languages. We treat such concurrent edit spikes as signals for potential breaking news events, whose plausibility we then check with full-text cross-language searches on multiple social networks. Unlike the reverse approach of monitoring social networks first, and potentially checking plausibility on Wikipedia second, the approach proposed in this paper has the advantage of being less prone to false-positive alerts, while being equally sensitive to true-positive events, however, at only a fraction of the processing cost.},

In this paper, we instead seek to estimate the amount of time users have spent contributing. Through an analysis of Wikipedia log data, we identify a pattern of punctuated bursts in editors' activity that we refer to as edit sessions. Based on these edit sessions, we build a metric that approximates the labor hours of editors in the encyclopedia. Using this metric, we first compare labor-based analyses with output-based analyses, finding that the activity of many editors can appear quite differently based on the kind of metric used. Second, we use edit session data to examine phenomena that cannot be adequately studied with purely output-based metrics, such as the total number of labor hours for the entire project.},

  abstract  = {Wikipedia has grown to become the most successful online encyclopedia on the Web, containing over 24 million articles, offered in over 240 languages. In just over 10 years Wikipedia has transformed from being just an encyclopedia of knowledge, to a wealth of facts and information, from articles discussing trivia, political issues, geographies and demographics, to popular culture, news articles, and social events. In this paper we explore the use of Wikipedia for identifying the flow of information and trends across the world. We start with the hypothesis that, given that Wikipedia is a resource that is globally available in different languages across countries, access to its articles could be a reflection human activity. To explore this hypothesis we try to establish metrics on the use of Wikipedia in order to identify potential trends and to establish whether or how those trends flow from one county to another. We subsequently compare the outcome of this analysis to that of more established methods that are based on online social media or traditional media. We explore this hypothesis by applying our approach to a subset of Wikipedia articles and also a specific worldwide social phenomenon that occurred during 2012; we investigate whether access to relevant Wikipedia articles correlates to the viral success of the South Korean pop song, "Gangnam Style" and the associated artist "PSY" as evidenced by traditional and online social media. Our analysis demonstrates that Wikipedia can indeed provide a useful measure for detecting social trends and events, and in the case that we studied; it could have been possible to identify the specific trend quicker in comparison to other established trend identification services such as Google Trends.},

  abstract   = {Although web-enabled collective intelligence (CI) plays a critical role in organizational innovation and collaboration, the dubious quality of CI is still a substantial problem faced by many CI services. Thus, it is important to identify determinants of CI quality and to analyze the relationship between CI quality and its usefulness. One of the most successful services of web-enabled CI is Wikipedia accessible all over the world. Another type of CI service is Naver KnowledgeiN, a typical and popular CI site offering question and answer (Q\&A) services in Korea. Wikipedia is a multilingual and web-based encyclopedia. Thus, it is necessary to study the influence relationships among CI quality, its determinants, and CI usefulness according to different CI type and languages. In this paper, we propose a new research model reflecting multi-dimensional factors related to CI quality from user’s perspective. To test a total of 15 hypotheses drawn from the research model, a total of 691 responses were collected from Wikipedia and KnowledgeiN users in South Korea and US. Expertise of contributors, community size, and diversity of contributors were identified as determinants of perceived CI quality. Perceived CI quality has significantly influenced on perceived CI usefulness from user’s perspective. CI type and different language partially play a role of moderators. The expertise of contributors plays a more important role in CI quality in the case of Q\&A services such as KnowledgeiN compared to Wiki services such as Wikipedia. This implies that Q\&A service requires more expertise and experiences in particular areas rather than the case of Wiki service to improve service quality. The relationship between community size and perceived CI quality was different according to CI type. The community size has a greater effect on CI quality in case of Wiki service than that of Q\&A service. The number of contributors in Wikipedia is important because Wiki is an encyclopedia service which is edited and revised repeatedly from many contributors while the answer given in Naver KnowledgeiN cannot be edited by others. Finally, CI quality has a greater effect on its usefulness in case of Wiki service rather than Q\&A service. In this paper, we suggested implications for practitioners and theorists.},

However, Wikipedia has been criticized for its low information quality, lack of accountability, inconsistency, and vulnerability to vandalism. Despite the warnings and concerns voiced by academia, online learning tools such as Wikipedia will continue their rise as major learning resource in today's classroom. Using a sample of 184 college students, the study proposed theoretical models to test the effects of internal beliefs, motivations, and social influences on Wikipedia use and information-seeking, and further empirically tested those models. The findings of this study suggested that Wikipedia use is driven by internal belief and peer pressure, whereas information-seeking is influenced by belief, motivation, and subjective norms. The implications of the findings for the research and practice are discussed.

However, there has been less attention in citizen science projects to use the public to disseminate scientific knowledge. Wikipedia provides a platform to study engagement of citizen scientists in knowledge dissemination. College and university students are especially appropriate members of the public to write science articles, because of the course-work and mentorship they receive from faculty. This paper describes a project to support students' writing of scientific articles in Wikipedia. In collaboration with a scientific association, we involved 640 students from 36 courses in editing scientific articles on Wikipedia. This paper provides details in the design of the program and our quantitative and qualitative approaches to evaluating it. Our results show that the Wikipedia classroom experiment benefits both the Wikipedia community and students. Undergraduate and graduate students substantially improved the scientific content of over 800 articles, at a level of quality indistinguishable from content written by PhD experts. Both students and faculty endorsed the motivational benefits of an authentic writing experience that would be read by thousands of people.},

Subsequently, it poses a great challenge to traditional encyclopedias, which for centuries have set the standards of society's knowledge with their printed editions. It is, therefore, important to study the impact of social media on the standards of our knowledge. This longitudinal panel study analyzed the framing of content in encyclopedia entries of top Fortune companies in Wikipedia and the online version of Encyclopedia Britannica in 2006, 2008, and 2010. Content analyses of the length, tonality, and topics of 3,985 sentences showed that Wikipedia entries were significantly longer, were more positively and negatively framed, and focused more on corporate social responsibilities and legal and ethical issues than the online entries of the traditional encyclopedia, which were predominantly neutral. The findings stress that the knowledge-generation processes in society appear to be fundamentally shifting because of the use of social media collaboration. These changes significantly impact which information becomes available to society and how it is framed.},

This article addresses the role of Wikipedia in the production of knowledge in a sport history context. An analysis of 115 Wikipedia articles written about notable Australian sportspeople revealed a disproportionately large group of high-quality cricket biographies. Further investigation revealed that a small group of Wikipedians were responsible for writing these articles. The work of this community of practice is indicative of the influence that dedicated special interest groups can have over the production of knowledge on Wikipedia and raises broader questions about the production of knowledge in sport history.},

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the most famous and well supported example of a VGI project on the Internet today. As a technology, Digital Earth (DE) offers immediate access to enormous quantities of data and information, referenced by locations on the surface of the planet. One of DE's goals is to make global spatial information ubiquitously available as an essential component of democracy. OSM's mission is well positioned within this goal where OSM aims to create a freely available editable map database of the world. This paper explores the characteristics of the collaborative, crowd-based, editing of spatial data in OSM and the crowd itself. We provide some conclusions on how OSM can be best integrated into the fabric of DE.},

But while the success of Wikipedia can be attributed in part to the simplicity of adding and modifying content, this has also created challenges when it comes to using, querying, and integrating the information. Even though authors are encouraged to select appropriate categories and provide infoboxes that follow pre-defined templates, many do not follow the guidelines or follow them loosely. This leads to undesirable effects, such as template duplication, heterogeneity, and schema drift. As a step towards addressing this problem, we propose a new unsupervised approach for clustering Wikipedia infoboxes. Instead of relying on manually assigned categories and template labels, we use the structured information available in infoboxes to group them and infer their entity types. Experiments using over 48,000 infoboxes indicate that our clustering approach is effective and produces high quality clusters.},

In many cases, real-life events like new scientific findings, resignations, deaths, or catastrophes serve as triggers for collaborative editing of articles about affected entities such as persons or countries. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of event-related updates in Wikipedia by examining different indicators for events including language, meta annotations, and update bursts. We then study how these indicators can be employed for automatically detecting event-related updates. Our experiments on event extraction, clustering, and summarization show promising results towards generating entity-specific news tickers and timelines.},

Given its radical departure from previous encyclopedias, it is not surprising that it is controversial. Wikipedia is freely editable, leading to debates over accuracy and writing style. It has also included topics, especially in the area of popular culture, which some believe are not appropriate for a serious, comprehensive encyclopedia. In this article, I do not examine these arguments, but, rather, a different problem confronting Wikipedia. Through a case study of Cambodian history articles, I demonstrate how Wikipedia limits itself through a largely unconscious appropriation of the dominant discourse of representation surrounding its objects of inquiry. When article quality is examined, a distinct pattern emerges that can readily be matched to the dominant historiographical tradition of Cambodian history. As well as presenting this case study as a demonstration of the influence of dominant discursive narratives, I wish to contextualize this privileging of particular discourses within debates about the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) that emerged in the 1970s. I argue that the NWICO can be useful in our thinking about the relationship of information professionals to Wikipedia today.},

But, around 10\% of these students have dyslexia, which impairs their access to text-based websites. How could Wikipedia be presented to be more readable for this target group? In an experiment with 28 participants with dyslexia, we compare reading speed, comprehension, and subjective readability for the font sizes 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, and 26 points, and line spacings 0.8, 1.0, 1.4, and 1.8. The results show that font size has a significant effect on the readability and the understandability of the text, while line spacing does not. On the basis of our results, we recommend using 18-point font size when designing web text for readers with dyslexia. Our results significantly differ from previous recommendations, presumably, because this is the first work to cover a wide range of values and to study them in the context of an actual website.},

  abstract   = {This paper contributes to debates about the implications of digital technology for social research by proposing the concept of the redistribution of methods. In the context of digitization, I argue, social research becomes noticeably a distributed accomplishment: online platforms, users, devices and informational practices actively contribute to the performance of digital social research. This also applies more specifically to social research methods, and this paper explores the phenomenon in relation to two specific digital methods, online network and textual analysis, arguing that sociological research stands much to gain from engaging with their distribution, both normatively and analytically speaking. I distinguish four predominant views on the redistribution of digital social methods: methods-as-usual, big methods, virtual methods and digital methods. Taking up this last notion, I propose that a redistributive understanding of social research opens up a new approach to the re-mediation of social methods in digital environments. I develop this argument through a discussion of two particular online research platforms: the Issue Crawler, a web-based platform for hyperlink analysis, and the Co-Word Machine, an online tool of textual analysis currently under development. Both these tools re-mediate existing social methods, and both, I argue, involve the attempt to render specific methodology critiques effective in the online realm, namely critiques of the authority effects implicit in citation analysis. As such, these methods offer ways for social research to intervene critically in digital social research, and more specifically, to endorse and actively pursue the re-distribution of social methods online.},

  abstract = {How different cultures evaluate a person? Is an important person in one culture is also important in the other culture? We address these questions via ranking of multilingual Wikipedia articles. With three ranking algorithms based on network structure of Wikipedia, we assign ranking to all articles in 9 multilingual editions of Wikipedia and investigate general ranking structure of PageRank, CheiRank and 2DRank. In particular, we focus on articles related to persons, identify top 30 persons for each rank among different editions and analyze distinctions of their distributions over activity fields such as politics, art, science, religion, sport for each edition. We find that local heroes are dominant but also global heroes exist and create an effective network representing entanglement of cultures. The Google matrix analysis of network of cultures shows signs of the Zipf law distribution. This approach allows to examine diversity and shared characteristics of knowledge organization between cultures. The developed computational, data driven approach highlights cultural interconnections in a new perspective.},

This is useful when one wants to understand relationships among entities but can only observe their behavior, but not direct interactions with one another. This is the kind of environment prevelant in network monitoring, where one can observe behavior coming into and leaving a network from many different hosts, but cannot directly observe which hosts are related to one another. In this paper, we show that networks of individuals inferred using the transfer entropy of Wikipedia editing behavior predicts observed "ground truth" social networks. At low levels of recall, transfer entropy can extract these social networks with a precision approximately 20 times higher than would be expected by chance. We'll discuss the algorithm, the data set, and various parameter considerations when attempting to apply this algorithm to a data set.},

Time-consuming and laborious attention to textual discussions is needed to make such decisions, for which computer support would be beneficial. Yet there has been little study of the argumentation patterns that distributed ad-hoc online task groups use in evaluation and decision-making. In a corpus of English Wikipedia deletion discussions, we investigate the argumentation schemes used, the role of the arguer's experience, and which arguments are acceptable to the audience. We report three main results: First, the most prevalent patterns are the Rules and Evidence schemes from Walton's catalog of argumentation schemes [33], which comprise 36\% of arguments. Second, we find that familiarity with community norms correlates with the novices' ability to craft persuasive arguments. Third, acceptable arguments use community-appropriate rhetoric that demonstrate knowledge of policies and community values while problematic arguments are based on personal preference and inappropriate analogy to other cases.},

Here we challenge this viewpoint by contextualizing Wikipedia and its modes of production on a broad temporal scale. Drawing on examples from Roman antiquity onward, but focusing on the years since 1700, we identify three forms of encyclopedic production: compulsive collection, stigmergic accumulation, and corporate production. While each could be characterized as a discrete period, we point out the existence of significant overlaps in time as well as with the production of Wikipedia today. Our analysis explores the relation of editors, their collaborators, and their modes of composition with respect to changing notions of authorship and originality. Ultimately, we hope our contribution will help scholars avoid ahistorical claims about Wikipedia, identify historical cases germane to the social scientist’s concerns, and show that contemporary questions about Wikipedia have a lifespan exceeding the past decade.},

They are elected using a special procedure defined by the Wikipedia community, called Request for Adminship (RfA). Because of the growing amount of management work (quality control, coordination, maintenance) on the Wikipedia, the importance of admins is growing. At the same time, there exists evidence that the admin community is growing more slowly than expected. We present an analysis of the RfA procedure in the Polish-language Wikipedia, since the procedure’s introduction in 2005. With the goal of discovering good candidates for new admins that could be accepted by the community, we model the admin elections using multidimensional behavioral social networks derived from the Wikipedia edit history. We find that we can classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be sufficient to recommend candidates. We also propose and verify interpretations of the dimensions of the social network. We find that one of the dimensions, based on discussion on Wikipedia talk pages, can be validly interpreted as acquaintance among editors, and discuss the relevance of this dimension to the admin elections.},

DSH is a novel high-level database query facility allowing for the formulation and efficient execution of queries on nested and ordered collections of data. DSH grew out of a research project on the integration of database querying capabilities into high-level, general-purpose programming languages. It is an emerging trend that querying facilities embedded in general-purpose programming languages are gradually replacing lower-level database languages such as SQL as preferred facilities for querying large-scale database-resident data. We relate this new approach to the current practice which integrates database queries into analysts’ workflows in a rather ad hoc fashion. This paper would interest early technology adopters interested in new database query languages and practitioners working on large-scale data analysis.},

these users are and why they begin to contribute. Importantly,
there is scant empirical evidence on how motivations are associated
with different trajectories of participation for new participants.
Our study addresses this gap by combining a survey of new
Wikipedia editors’ motivations with an exploratory analysis of
the editors’ activity logs. Using clustering techniques to identify
prototypical activity profiles from log data, we observe what motivations
are associated with which prototypical activities. We
find that new editors’ motivations are predictive of their future
activity. In particular our results indicate that reputation, social,
enjoyment, and obligation motives differ among editor activity
clusters.},

  abstract = {The proportion of women editors on the English language Wikipedia has for years been known
to be very low. The purpose of this thesis is to see if this gender gap exists on the Swedish
language Wikipedia as well, and investigate the reasons behind it.
To do this, three methods are used. Firstly a literature review is conducted, looking at women in
computing and how Wikipedia works and how it was founded. Secondly, user behavior and
activity-levels are measured through means of a database analysis of editors and edits. And
thirdly, a survey is distributed, aimed at both readers and editors of Swedish Wikipedia,
gathering some 2700 respondents.
The results indicate that there is indeed a big disproportion, and that only between 13-19\% of
editors are women. The findings did not indicate readers of the encyclopedia having any strong
negative preconceptions about Wikipedia or its community. However when looking at reasons
for not contributing, women were significantly more likely to perceive themselves as not
competent enough to edit. Computer skills were found to be an important factor for trying out
editing in the first place, and Wikipedia’s connection to a male-dominated
computing/programming culture is put forth as a reason for the resilience of the gender gap. The
difference in men’s and women’s communication styles in relation to the climate Wikipedia’s
policies and guidelines is also discussed.},

However, because it is jointly written by many contributors, it is subject to constant manipulation by contributors attempting to add biographies of non-notable people. Over time, Wikipedia has developed inclusion criteria for notable people (e.g., receiving a significant award) based on which newly contributed biographies are evaluated. In this paper we present and analyze a set of simple indicators that can be used to predict which article will eventually be accepted. These indicators do not refer to the content itself, but to meta-content features (such as the number of categories that the biography is associated with) and to author-based features (such as if it is a first-time author). By training a classifier on these features, we successfully reached a high predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC] of 0.97) even though we overlooked the actual biography text.},

Initially in English, the popular website has grown to include versions in over 288 languages. These versions and their articles are interconnected via cross-language links, which not only facilitate navigation and understanding of concepts in multiple languages, but have been used in natural language processing applications, developments in linked open data, and expansion of minor Wikipedia language versions. These applications are the motivation for an automatic, robust, and accurate technique to identify cross-language links. In this paper, we present a multilingual approach called EurekaCL to automatically identify missing cross-language links in Wikipedia. More precisely, given a Wikipedia article (the source) EurekaCL uses the multilingual and semantic features of BabelNet 2.0 in order to efficiently identify a set of candidate articles in a target language that are likely to cover the same topic as the source. The Wikipedia graph structure is then exploited both to prune and to rank the candidates. Our evaluation carried out on 42,000 pairs of articles in eight language versions of Wikipedia shows that our candidate selection and pruning procedures allow an effective selection of candidates which significantly helps the determination of the correct article in the target language version.},

To determine the completeness and readability of information found in Wikipedia for leading dietary supplements and assess the accuracy of this information with regard to safety (including use during pregnancy/lactation), contraindications, drug interactions, therapeutic uses, and dosing.   Design
Cross-sectional analysis of Wikipedia articles.   Interventions
The contents of Wikipedia articles for the 19 top-selling herbal supplements were retrieved on July 24, 2012, and evaluated for organization, content, accuracy (as compared with information in two leading dietary supplement references) and readability.   Main Outcome Measures
Accuracy of Wikipedia articles.   Results
No consistency was noted in how much information was included in each Wikipedia article, how the information was organized, what major categories were used, and where safety and therapeutic information was located in the article. All articles in Wikipedia contained information on therapeutic uses and adverse effects but several lacked information on drug interactions, pregnancy, and contraindications. Wikipedia articles had 26\%–75\% of therapeutic uses and 76\%–100\% of adverse effects listed in the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database and/or Natural Standard. Overall, articles were written at a 13.5-grade level, and all were at a ninth-grade level or above.   Conclusion
Articles in Wikipedia in mid-2012 for the 19 top-selling herbal supplements were frequently incomplete, of variable quality, and sometimes inconsistent with reputable sources of information on these products. Safety information was particularly inconsistent among the articles. Patients and health professionals should not rely solely on Wikipedia for information on these herbal supplements when treatment decisions are being made.},

We use an axiomatic theory for multi-level modeling to analyze current Wikidata content, and identify a significant number of problematic classification and taxonomic statements.

on the entity’s Wikipedia page usually
gets updated. At the same time, the
article text may be updated with verbs either
being added or deleted to reflect the
changes made to the infobox. We use
Wikipedia edit history to distantly supervise
a method for automatically learning
verbs and state changes. Additionally, our
method uses constraints to effectively map
verbs to infobox changes. We observe in
our experiments that when state-changing
verbs are added or deleted from an entity’s
Wikipedia page text, we can predict
the entity’s infobox updates with 88\% precision
and 76\% recall. One compelling
application of our verbs is to incorporate
them as triggers in methods for updating
existing KBs, which are currently mostly
static.},

  abstract    = {French Abstract:Résumé: Le numérique, en permettant le développement de grands projets collaboratifs de production de connaissance, a renouvelé notre vision de cette production ainsi que l'analyse économique du fonctionnement des communs (informationnels). Si la motivation des contributeurs à participer à ces communs fait l'objet d'une littérature importante, les réflexions sur l'accès de tous (contributeurs ou non) à ces biens, et sur le financement de cet accès, sont moins nombreuses, alors que les coûts induits sont loin d'être négligeables (par exemple, environ 21 millions de dollars pour Wikipedia en 2014). L'objectif de cette contribution est de proposer une méthode d'évaluation de la valeur que les utilisateurs attribuent à cet accès, en comparant deux expressions de cette valeur, la disposition à payer et le don. Cela nous permet de comprendre leurs motivations à financer (par exemple existence ou non de warm glow), tout en mettant en évidence les facteurs influençant le "crowding out". Cette contribution s'inscrit dans le cadre de la littérature sur le financement des biens publics hors financement par l'impôt.English Abstract: Allowing the development of large collaborative knowledge-production projects, the Internet has renewed our vision of this type of production and the economics analysis of how information commons work. If a vast literature has studied contributor's motivation to participate in such production of commons, reflections on universal access to these goods (being contributors or not), and the financing of this, are fewer, despite the fact that the induced costs are far from negligible (for example, about \$21 millions to Wikipedia in 2014). The aim of this contribution is to provide a method for assessing the value attributed by users to access, by comparing two expressions of this value, willingness to pay and donation. This allows us to discuss their motivations to fund (e.g. whether there is or not warm glow), while highlighting the factors influencing the 'crowding out'. This contribution refers to the literature on the financing of public goods excluding tax financing.},

A vast untapped potential lies in the dynamic aspects of these resources, which cannot be unleashed with traditional methods designed for static corpora. In this chapter, we focus on Wikipedia as the most prominent instance of collaboratively constructed language resources. In particular, we discuss the significance of Wikipedi’s revision history for applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the unique prospects of the user discussions, a new resource that has just begun to be mined. While the body of research on processing Wikipedia’s revision history is dominated by works that use the revision data as the basis for practical applications such as spelling correction or vandalism detection, most of the work focused on user discussions uses NLP for analyzing and understanding the data itself.},

  abstract   = {A business problem for the telecommunication companies is to provide an appropriate promotional coupon to suitable customers. This problem leads to the challenge of identifying behavioral patterns of customers and deliver the right customer engagement at the right time. So there is a need for a system that can enable the telecommunication companies to go for the best marketing strategy by leveraging customer intelligence to drive offer acceptance based on personas. Technically it is possible for the telecommunication companies to recommend suitable advertisements if they can classify the web sites browsed by their customers into classes like sports, e-commerce, social networking, streaming media etc. Another problem is to classify a new website when it doesn't belong to any of the existing clusters. In this paper, the authors are going to propose a method to automatically classify the websites and synthesize the cluster names in case it doesn't belong to any of the predefined clusters. We have experimented on a small set of data set and the classification results are quite convincing. Moreover, the phrases used to describe a website if it doesn't belong to existing classes are compliant to the phrases obtained from manual annotation. This proposed system uses the Wikipedia data to construct the document for the websites browsed by the customers.},

Its contents correspond to almost all the knowledge areas and are altruistically contributed by individuals and organizations. In addition, users are encouraged to add their own contributions according to the Wikipedia’s own supporting paradigm. Its progression to a mass phenomenon has propitiated many studies and research initiatives. Therefore, topics such as the quality of the published contents or the authoring of its contributions have been widely developed. However, very few attention has been paid to the behavioral aspects characterizing the interaction between Wikipedia and its users. Henceforth, this chapter aims to determine the habits exhibited by users when browsing the Wikipedia pages. Particularly, we will focus on visits and contributions, as they constitute the two most common forms of interaction. Our study is based on a sample of the requests submitted to Wikipedia, and its results are twofold: on the one hand, it provides different metrics concerning users’ behavior and, on the other, presents particular comparisons among different Wikipedia editions.},

  abstract   = {This paper examines research about Wikipedia that has been undertaken using big data approaches. The aim is to gauge the coherence as against the disparateness of studies from different disciplines, how these studies relate to each other, and to research about Wikipedia and new social media in general. The paper is partly based on interviews with big data researchers, and discusses a number of themes and implications of Wikipedia research, including about the workings of online collaboration, the way that contributions mirror (or not) aspects of real-world geographies, and how contributions can be used to predict offline social and economic trends. Among the findings is that in some areas of research, studies build on and extend each other's results. However, most of the studies stay within disciplinary silos and could be better integrated with other research on Wikipedia and with research about new media. Wikipedia is among few sources in big data research where the data are openly available, unlike many studies where data are proprietary. Thus, it has lent itself to a burgeoning and promising body of research. The paper concludes that in order to fulfil this promise, this research must pay more attention to theories and research from other disciplines, and also go beyond questions based narrowly on the availability of data and towards a more powerful analytical grasp of the phenomenon being investigated.},

Wikidata is a likewise global crowdsourced knowledge base that provides shared facts to be used by Wikipedias. In the context of this research, we have developed an application and an underlying Application Programming Interface (API) capable of monitoring realtime edit activity of all language versions of Wikipedia and Wikidata. This application allows us to easily analyze edits in order to answer questions such as "Bots vs. Wikipedians, who edits more?", "Which is the most anonymously edited Wikipedia?", or "Who are the bots and what do they edit?". To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such an analysis was done for Wikidata and for really all Wikipedias---large and small. According to our results, all Wikipedias and Wikidata together are edited by about 50\% bots and by about 23\% anonymous users. Wikidata alone accounts for about 48\% of the totally observed edits. If we do not consider Wikidata, i.e., if we only look at all Wikipedias, about 15\% of all edits are made by bots and 26\% of all edits are made by anonymous users. Overall, we found a stabilizing number of 274 active bots during our observation period. Our application is available publicly online at the URL http://wikipedia-edits.herokuapp.com/, its code has been open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license.},

Test results show that the extension has a negligible impact on performance. Two 302 status code datetime negotiation patterns, as defined by Memento, have been examined for the extension: Pattern 1.1, which requires 2 requests, versus Pattern 2.1, which requires 3 requests. Our test results and mathematical review find that, contrary to intuition, Pattern 2.1 performs better than Pattern 1.1 due to idiosyncrasies in MediaWiki. In addition to implementing Memento, Version 2.0 allows administrators to choose the optional 200-style datetime negotiation Pattern 1.2 instead of Pattern 2.1. It also permits administrators the ability to have the Memento MediaWiki Extension return full HTTP 400 and 500 status codes rather than using standard MediaWiki error pages. Finally, version 2.0 permits administrators to turn off recommended Memento headers if desired. Seeing as much of our work focuses on producing the correct revision of a wiki page in response to a user's datetime input, we also examine the problem of finding the correct revisions of the embedded resources, including images, stylesheets, and JavaScript; identifying the issues and discussing whether or not MediaWiki must be changed to support this functionality.},

Drawing on the concepts of capability and routine, we develop a dynamic, process-oriented view that departs from past research focused on static comparative analysis. We theorize that online social production systems develop a collective governance capability to steer the process of integrating distributed knowledge resources to the production of value. Governance mechanisms emerge from individual and collective learning that is made possible by new technology, and they evolve over time, as routines are developed to respond to new problems faced by a growing production system. Using Wikipedia as a paradigmatic example of online social production, we characterize governance as an evolving, enabling and embedded process and discuss implications for a dynamic theory of governance.},

Observing a sample of 7, 635 articles over a period of 153 weeks we measure their centrality both within this category and in the network of over one million Wikipedia articles. Our analysis reveals that an additional link from the observed category is associated with around 140 bytes of additional content and with an increase in the number of authors by 0.5. The relation of links from outside the category to content creation is much weaker. Beyond the econometric analysis, our study sheds light on how the discipline of economics is represented on German Wikipedia. We find non-neoclassical themes to be highly prevalent among the top articles.},

However, there have been concerns over the quality of online health information, particularly that on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). This exploratory study aimed to evaluate several page attributes of articles on CAM in the English Wikipedia. A total of 97 articles were analyzed and compared with eight articles of broad categories of therapies in conventional medicine using the Mann-Whitney U test. Based on the Wikipedia editorial assessment grading, 4\&\#x25; of the articles attained \&\#x201C;good article\&\#x201D; status, 34\&\#x25; required considerable editing, and 56\&\#x25; needed substantial improvements in their content. The median daily access of the articles over the previous 90 days was 372 (range: 7\&\#x2013;4,214). The median word count was 1840 with a readability of grade 12.7 (range: 9.4\&\#x2013;17.7). Medians of word count and citation density of the CAM articles were significantly lower than those in the articles of conventional medicine therapies. In conclusion, despite its limitations, the general public will continue to access health information on Wikipedia. There are opportunities for health professionals to contribute their knowledge and to improve the accuracy and completeness of the CAM articles on Wikipedia.},

Computational fact checking may significantly enhance our ability to evaluate the veracity of dubious information. Here we show that the complexities of human fact checking can be approximated quite well by finding the shortest path between concept nodes under properly defined semantic proximity metrics on knowledge graphs. Framed as a network problem this approach is feasible with efficient computational techniques. We evaluate this approach by examining tens of thousands of claims related to history, entertainment, geography, and biographical information using a public knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia. Statements independently known to be true consistently receive higher support via our method than do false ones. These findings represent a significant step toward scalable computational fact-checking methods that may one day mitigate the spread of harmful misinformation.},

Accurate detection would enable many beneficial applications, such as alerting search users to controversy. Wikipedia's broad coverage and rich metadata offer a valuable resource for this problem. We hypothesize that intensities of controversy among related pages are not independent; thus, we propose a stacked model which exploits the dependencies among related pages. Our approach improves classification of controversial web pages when compared to a model that examines each page in isolation, demonstrating that controversial topics exhibit homophily. Using notions of similarity to construct a subnetwork for collective classification, rather than using the default network present in the relational data, leads to improved classification with wider applications for semi-structured datasets, with the effects most pronounced when a small set of neighbors is used.},

This article considers the unique challenge that Wikipedia poses for copyright’s rules of subsistence. The article is structured in three parts. The first part outlines the model of collective authorship which thrives on Wikipedia – describing how Wikipedia works and suggests some reasons why it works. The second part offers a critical analysis of the relationship between collective authorship on Wikipedia and the concept of a work of joint authorship in copyright law. In particular, this part considers whether: (i) Wikipedia as a whole, or individual Wikipedia pages are original literary works in which copyright subsists; and (ii) whether Wikipedia contributors are joint authors and thus copyright owners. The third part examines the role of copyleft licences in sustaining collective authorship on Wikipedia and considers the ongoing relevance of copyright law standards in this context. The article concludes that the example of Wikipedia reveals some unanswered questions that lie at the heart of copyright’s notion of authorship, providing an opportunity to reconsider the way in which this notion has been understood to date and how it might adapt to creativity in the modern digital environment.},

At what point does a community achieve critical mass, and how does the community know this? Furthermore, online communities become sustainable when they achieve a mass of what? We explore this question by analyzing growth in a large number of online communities on Wikipedia. We find that individual communities often have different patterns of growth of membership from its pattern of growth of contribution or production. We also find that in the early stages of community development, building membership has a greater impact on community production and activity in later periods than accumulating many contributions early on, and this is especially true when there is more diversity in the early participants in a community. We also show that participation from a community's "power users" in its early stage is not as valuable to sustainability as the collective contributions of those who make only small contributions. We argue that critical mass is established by developing a diverse set of community members with heterogeneous interests and resources, and not purely by accumulating content.},

  abstract = {Knowledge acquisition still represents one of the main challenging obstacles to designing intelligent systems exhibiting human-level performance in complex intelligent tasks. The recent developments in crowdsourcing technologies have opened new promising opportunities to overcome this problem by exploiting large amounts of machine readable knowledge to perform tasks requiring human intelligence. Wikipedia is a case of this research trend, being the largest collaborative and multilingual resource and linguistic knowledge that contains unstructured and semi-structured information. In this paper, we propose an approach for deriving “is a” taxonomy from the Wikipedia Categories Graph (WCG), which is an open collaborative resource. After building and filtering the WCG from a Wikipedia dump, the process would mainly consist in the exploitation of the “BY” tag and the sharing of plural headers. These methods provide a graph formed by a set of non-connected sub-graphs. Therefore, we propose a process for linking them to finally obtain an “is a” taxonomy with only one root and modeled as a direct acyclic graph (DAG). In this work, specific DAG handling algorithms are used, including an algorithm for a DAG into sub-DAGs and another for merging two DAGs. The obtained taxonomy is assessed using semantic similarity measures, which consist in quantifying the likeness between two concepts or words. Therefore, we exploit a set of well-known benchmarks to compare the results obtained via the generated taxonomy to those achieved with WordNet, a resource created and maintained by domain experts. The experimental results revealed good correlations between computed values and human judgments. Compared to WordNet, the derived taxonomy was also noted to lead to an enhanced coverage capacity.},

Dem gegenüber steht das gemeinschaftliche Erarbeiten der Wörterbuch­inhalte, das ein völlig anderes Paradigma der Lexiko­graphie darstellt.

Das gemeinschaftliche Vorgehen wurde in der (meta-)lexikographischen Fach-literatur als kollaborative Erstellung (Storrer/Freese, 1996) und bottom-up lexicography (Carr, 1997) eingeführt, ist aber bis heute wenig erforscht. Insbesondere stellt sich für die Wörterbuchforschung die Frage, wie sich die freiwilligen Autoren organisieren und wie bei der Erarbeitung der Wörterbuchinhalte vorgegangen wird.
Im vorliegenden Beitrag analysieren wir das gemeinschaftlich erstellte Online-Wörterbuch Wik­tionary hinsichtlich dieser Fragestellung, um insbesondere herauszuarbeiten, inwieweit sich der in Wiktionary zugrundeliegende lexikographische Pro­zess mit den Prozessen redaktionell erstellter Wörter­bücher deckt bzw. sich davon unterscheidet. Unsere Auswertung bezieht sich auf das deutsche Wiktionary, das mit ca. 227.000 Artikelseiten das derzeit größte deutschsprachige, gemeinschaftlich erarbeitete Wörterbuch darstellt und daher sowohl qualitative als auch quantitative Untersuchungen in dieser Forschungsfrage ermöglicht.},

  abstract   = {This thesis focuses on gaining linguistic insights into textual discussions on a word level. It was of special interest to distinguish messages that constructively contribute to a discussion from those that are detrimental to them. Thereby, we wanted to determine whether “I”- and “You”-messages are indicators for either of the two discussion styles. These messages are nowadays often used in guidelines for successful communication. Although their effects have been successfully evaluated multiple times, a large-scale analysis has never been conducted. Thus, we used Wikipedia Articles for Deletion (short: AfD) discussions together with the records of blocked users and developed a fully automated creation of an annotated data set. In this data set, messages were labelled either constructive or disruptive. We applied binary classifiers to the data to determine characteristic words for both discussion styles. Thereby, we also investigated whether function words like pronouns and conjunctions play an important role in distinguishing the two. We found that “You”-messages were a strong indicator for disruptive messages which matches their attributed effects on communication. However, we found “I”-messages to be indicative for disruptive messages as well which is contrary to their attributed effects. The importance of function words could neither be confirmed nor refuted. Other characteristic words for either communication style were not found. Yet, the results suggest that a different model might represent disruptive and constructive messages in textual discussions better.},

Distributed wikis distribute their pages among the sites of autonomous participants to address various motivations, including high availability of data, new collaboration models and different viewpoints of subjects. Although existing systems share some common basic concepts, it is often difficult to understand the specificity of each one, the underlying complexities or the best context in which to use it. In this paper, we define, classify and characterize distributed wikis. We identify three classes of distributed wiki systems, each using a different collaboration model and distribution scheme for its pages: highly available wikis, decentralized social wikis and federated wikis. We classify existing distributed wikis according to these classes. We detail their underlying complexities and social and technical motivations. We also highlight some directions for research and opportunities for new systems with original social and technical motivations. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

One way to do it is by analysing the editorial activities and visitors' views of a set of Wikipedia articles. In this paper, we particularly study attention to aircraft incidents and accidents using Wikipedia in two different language editions, English and Spanish. We analyse how attention varies over several dimensions such as number of deaths, airline region, locale, date, first edit, etc. Several patterns emerge with regard to these dimensions and articles. For example, we find evidence that the attention given by Wikipedia editors to pre-Wikipedia aircraft incidents and accidents depends on the region of the airline for both English and Spanish editions. For instance, North American airline companies receive more prompt coverage in English Wikipedia. We also observe that the attention given by Wikipedia visitors is influenced by the airline region but only for events with high number of deaths. Finally we show that the rate and time span of the decay of attention is independent of the number of deaths and the airline region. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of attention bias.},

The study also compares the associations between the factors and uploading intentions of two different cultures, the United States and South Korea. Using data from surveys of college students from the two countries (n = 249 and 173), structural equation modeling analyses revealed that ego involvement not only plays an essential role in explaining uploading intention but also functions as an antecedent of attitude and perceived behavioral control in both countries. However, the subjective norm was not significantly associated with uploading intention in either country, and the descriptive norm was a marginally significant factor in accounting for uploading intention in the United States. Moreover, it was found that, only in the United States, attitude was significantly associated with uploading intention, whereas perceived behavioral control was a significant factor in explaining uploading intention in both countries. These findings suggest that the effects of cultural differences, the impact of subjective norms in particular, may be weakened with the more self-oriented nature of Web 2.0 applications and social media such as Wikipedia. Theoretical implications are discussed.},

We postulate that the high percentage of rejections of cases presented by non-administrators, the lack of diversity inside the committee (composed only by administrators), and the high number of cases involving administrators played a central role in its eventual downfall. We conclude that mechanisms that fail to acknowledge the ecosystem they are part of cannot succceed. Therefore, further research is needed to determine if granting more decision-making power to non-administrators may lead to more effective conflict resolution mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The cumulative effect of collective online participation has an important and adverse impact on individual privacy. As an online system evolves over time, new digital traces of individual behavior may uncover previously hidden statistical links between an individual's past actions and her private traits. To quantify this effect, we analyze the evolution of individual privacy loss by studying the edit history of Wikipedia over 13 years, including more than 117,523 different users performing 188,805,088 edits. We trace each Wikipedia's contributor using apparently harmless features, such as the number of edits performed on predefined broad categories in a given time period (e.g. Mathematics, Culture or Nature). We show that even at this unspecific level of behavior description, it is possible to use off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms to uncover usually undisclosed personal traits, such as gender, religion or education. We provide empirical evidence that the prediction accuracy for almost all private traits consistently improves over time. Surprisingly, the prediction performance for users who stopped editing after a given time still improves. The activities performed by new users seem to have contributed more to this effect than additional activities from existing (but still active) users. Insights from this work should help users, system designers, and policy makers understand and make long-term design choices in online content creation systems.},

  abstract  = {A key impact the Internet is having on university teaching involves the new choices being provided because of open educational content. Wikipedia is a clear example of these new options. It is a gigantic open repository of knowledge, and it can also be considered a platform that facilitates collaboration in knowledge creation and dissemination. Our research objective is to understand what the main factors are that influence the teaching uses of Wikipedia among university faculty. Based on a technology acceptance model, and using data from a survey sent to all faculty members of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, we analyze the relationships within the internal and external constructs of the model. We found that both the perception of colleagues' opinions about Wikipedia and the perceived quality of the information in Wikipedia play a central role. These two constructs have a significant direct impact on the perceived usefulness of Wikipedia. This perceived usefulness affects, mediated by the behavioral intention of using Wikipedia, the effective use behavior of the encyclopedia. The degree to which an individual considers it is important to participate in open collaborative environments and the Web 2.0 profile of the faculty members also play an important role in our model.},

  abstract   = {Lo scopo dello studio è comprendere i fenomeni alla base della fiducia degli utenti verso l'enciclopedia online Wikipedia. Per farlo è necessario prima di tutto comprendere e modellizzare l'organizzazione della struttura dei processi socio-produttivi sottostanti alla produzione del contenuto di Wikipedia, procedendo quindi nel verificare empiricamente e descrivere le capacità di autocorrezione della stessa. Oltre a quelli utilizzati in questo studio, saranno anche descritti gli approcci e i risultati trattati in letteratura, riportando i principali studi che nel corso degli anni hanno affrontato questi argomenti, sebbene mantenendoli indipendenti.
Per comprendere la struttura della community degli editor di Wikipedia, si è ipotizzata l'esistenza di un modello di tipo Core-Periphery. Per studiare il modello sono state eseguite delle analisi su dati derivanti da un campione di pagine della versione italiana di Wikipedia. I risultati ottenuti dall'analisi di queste informazioni rappresentano le basi utilizzate per la selezione delle pagine oggetto dell'iniezione degli errori, costituendo un metodo per stimare le diverse probabilità di autocorrezione per ciascuna pagina. Per quanto riguarda le capacità di resilienza di Wikipedia, i risultati sono ricavati utilizzando un approccio empirico. Questo consiste nell'inserimento di errori all'interno del campione di pagine sotto specifici vincoli metodologici per poi valutare in quanto tempo e con quali modalità questi errori vengono corretti.
E' stata effettuata un'analisi specifica per la scelta delle tipologie di errore e delle variabili da considerare nell'inserimento di questi. 
Questa analisi ha portato alla definizione di 2 esperimenti tra loro distinti, i cui risultati portano ad interessanti conclusioni sia visti separatamente che combinati tra loro. Sulla base dei risultati di questi esperimenti è stato possibile discutere sulle capacità di autocorrezione del sistema, elemento chiave nello studio delle dinamiche della fiducia verso Wikipedia.},

  abstract = {Seemingly similar individuals often experience drastically different success trajectories, with some repeatedly failing and others consistently succeeding. One explanation is preexisting variability along unobserved fitness dimensions that is revealed gradually through differential achievement. Alternatively, positive feedback operating on arbitrary initial advantages may increasingly set apart winners from losers, producing runaway inequality. To identify social feedback in human reward systems, we conducted randomized experiments by intervening in live social environments across the domains of funding, status, endorsement, and reputation. In each system we consistently found that early success bestowed upon arbitrarily selected recipients produced significant improvements in subsequent rates of success compared with the control group of nonrecipients. However, success exhibited decreasing marginal returns, with larger initial advantages failing to produce much further differentiation. These findings suggest a lesser degree of vulnerability of reward systems to incidental or fabricated advantages and a more modest role for cumulative advantage in the explanation of social inequality than previously thought.},

  note     = {Wikipedia is a public encyclopedia composed of millions of articles written daily by volunteer authors from different regions of the world. The articles contain links called cross-language links which relate corresponding articles across different languages. This feature is extremely useful for applications that work with automatic translation and multilingual information retrieval as it allows the assembly of comparable corpora. Thus, it is important to have a mechanism that automatically creates such links. This has been motivating the development of techniques to identify missing cross-language links. In this article, we present CLLFinder, an approach for finding missing cross-language links. The approach makes use of the links between categories and of the transitivity between existing cross-language links, as well as textual features extracted from the articles. Experiments using one million articles from the English and Portuguese Wikipedias attest the viability of CLLFinder. The results show that our approach has a recall of 96\% and a precision of 98\%, outperforming the baseline system, even though we employ simpler and fewer features.},

  abstract   = {Contributing to history has never been as easy as it is today. Anyone with access to the Web is able to play a part on Wikipedia, an open and free encyclopedia. Wikipedia, available in many languages, is one of the most visited websites in the world and arguably one of the primary sources of knowledge on the Web. However, not everyone is contributing to Wikipedia from a diversity point of view; several groups are severely underrepresented. One of those groups is women, who make up approximately 16\% of the current contributor community, meaning that most of the content is written by men. In addition, although there are specific guidelines of verifiability, notability, and neutral point of view that must be adhered by Wikipedia content, these guidelines are supervised and enforced by men. In this paper, we propose that gender bias is not about participation and representation only, but also about characterization of women. We approach the analysis of gender bias by defining a methodology for comparing the characterizations of men and women in biographies. In particular we refer to three dimensions of biographies: meta-data, language usage, and structure of the network built from links between articles. Our results show that, indeed, there are differences in characterization and structure. Some of these differences are reflected from the offline world documented by Wikipedia, but other differences can be attributed to gender bias in Wikipedia content. We contextualize these differences in feminist theory and discuss their implications for Wikipedia policy.},

  abstract  = {Abstract:  The Wikipedia project constitutes the currently most-used and most comprehensive online encyclopedia in the world (Schneider, 2008, p. 35) and is advertising itself as free and open for everyone, and in terms of an encyclopedia as diverse and balanced at all levels. But from a gender perspective there is a huge discrepancy in sex ratio within Wikipedia’s community. In 2005, researchers at University of Würzburg found that women constitute only 10 \% of German-language Wikipedia authors (Schroer\&amp;Hertel, 2009, p. 104). This fact leads to the presumption, that Wikipedia’s reflection of the world mediates and interprets a mainly male conception of the world and thus displays an inequality with reference to modern society. Proceeding from the assumption that women and men have different communication behaviours as well as different perceptions and interpretations of communication in almost all aspects of social interaction including e.g. conversational strategies, conflict management and negotiation skills, we hypothesize that these different ways of communication significantly affect the motivation of female Wikipedia contributors.    Keywords:  gender differences, Web 2.0, online encyclopedia, collaborative working, online communication    ***           Résumé :  Le projet Wikipédia est actuellement l’encyclopédie en ligne la plus utilisée ainsi que la plus complète au monde (Schneider, 2008, p. 35) et il se présente comme étant libre et ouvert à tous. En tant qu’encyclopédie, il affirme être diversifié et objectif à tous les niveaux. Du point de vue de l’égalité des sexes, il existe cependant une grande différence entre la part d’hommes et de femmes au sein de la communauté composant Wikipédia. En 2005, des chercheurs de l’Université de Wurtzbourg ont découvert que seulement 10\% des auteurs de Wikipédia en langue allemande sont des femmes (Schroer\&amp;Hertel, 2009, p. 104). Ce fait laisse présumer que la représentation du monde véhiculée par Wikipédia transmet et interprète une conception principalement masculine de ce même monde et qu’elle fait donc preuve d’une disparité par rapport à la société moderne.   Partant du principe que les femmes et les hommes ont différents comportements de communication ainsi que différentes perceptions et interprétations de la communication concernant presque tous les aspects de l’interaction sociale dont, entre autres, les stratégies de conversation, la gestion des conflits et les compétences de négociation, nous émettons l’hypothèse que ces différentes méthodes de communication exercent une influence considérable sur la motivation des contributrices de Wikipédia.

  abstract  = {This study compared gender across 289 language editions of Wikipedia. First, we analyzed the extent to which expressing gender is a diffused practice in various Wikipedias. We conclude that the differences in the amount of users expressing their gender can be explained by the differences in the interfaces, both the visibility of gender and the incentive to express it, especially during the process of the new user-profile creation. The second research question focused on the cross-Wikipedia evaluation of the gender gap. Overall results show that there is not a single sociotechnical system in which women constitute the majority, thus confirming that the gender gap is not just present in the English Wikipedia but it is diffused across all language editions of Wikipedia. However, there are notable differences: in some Wikipedias (Slovenian, Estonian, Lithuanian) the percentage of women is close to 40 percent, in others (Bengali, Hindi) it is around 4 percent, while on the English Wikipedia, the chosen baseline given its international nature reaches 17 percent. Notably, languages whose editions of Wikipedia have larger shares of women tend to be spoken in countries with a larger participation of women in science. In conclusion, we observe that, even if Wikipedia is an online system, it reflects the real-world societies that inhabit the different language versions of it, and across languages and countries there are differences in women participation in public life. In particular, given that the context of Wikipedia is about creating knowledge, the best explanatory factor is the participation of women in knowledge-creation activities: the gender gap in different language editions of Wikipedia reflects the gender gap in science across the different countries of the real world. Future research should conduct interviews with Wikipedians to identify benefits and drawbacks of visible gender settings as well as possible techniques that would encourage more diverse populations of these sociotechnical systems. - See more at: http://www.gnuband.org/papers/gender-gap-in-wikipedia-editing-a-cross-language-comparison/\#sthash.LCqHelTm.dpuf},

Disease surveillance, traditionally based on patient visits to health providers and laboratory tests, can reduce these impacts. Motivated by cost and timeliness, surveillance methods based on internet data have recently emerged, but are not yet reliable for several reasons, including weak scientific peer review, breadth of diseases and countries covered, and underdeveloped forecasting capabilities. We argue that these challenges can be overcome by using a freely available data source: aggregated access logs from the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Using simple statistical techniques, our proof-of-concept experiments suggest that these data are effective for predicting the present, as well as forecasting up to the 28-day limit of our tests. Our results also suggest that these models can be used even in places with no official data upon which to build models. In short, this paper establishes the utility of Wikipedia as a broadly effective data source for disease information, and we outline a path to a reliable, scientifically sound, operational, and global disease surveillance system that overcomes key gaps in existing traditional and internet-based techniques.},

We then provide an explicit quantitative example drawn from ongoing work on cooperation and conflict among Wikipedia editors. We show the limitations of methodological individualism, and the substantial benefits that come from being able to refer to collective intentions and attributions of cognitive states of the form "what the group believes" and "what the group values".},

  abstract   = {An innovative study of Wikipedia biographical pages is presented. It is shown that the dates of some historical cataclysms may be reproduced from peculiarities of lifespan changes over time. Time dependence of number of biographical pages related to a year has a broken linear trend in logarithmic scale. It shows a sudden change of the slope from 0.0006 to 0.008 per year near 1700 AC. Presumably, this reflects the emergence of new ways of information dissemination associated with printing of books and newspapers. Cultural or historical significance of a person is measured using a number of proper Wikipedia references. We divided human activity into nine categories using keyword search. They cover over 97\% of the extracted data. Time dependencies of shares of each category reveal evolution of priorities or interests of mankind. Finally, categories were merged in just two classes. We call them Personal and Public, introducing a new index of human priorities as a ratio of Personal to Public. Being quite constant during almost the entire history, the index shows a sharp jump at the end of the 20th century mainly due to growth of Sport and Art groups over all others. We consider this as a kind of revolution.},

We investigated the accuracy of Wikipedia entries in the areas of health, nutrition, medicine, and complementary and alternative medicine. We formulated 32 statements which are often stated but are probably incorrect ("common misconceptions"). Using Google we found 49 Wikipedia entries that provided information on these 32 statements. Most entries are accurate, but deficiencies are present in a minority. The information provided by Wikipedia has a high degree of accuracy for 23 (72\%) of the 32 common misconceptions (19 had a score of 5, the highest mark possible, and 4 had a score of 4.5–4.7). Seven of them (22\%) had a score of 4–4.1, indicating that the entry has a minor error or that significant information is missing. Two had a low score (3.5), which indicates a more serious problem. Of all the 49 Wikipedia entries that were evaluated, four had a score of only 3, indicating that the accuracy is seriously flawed or that no information is given. These findings together with those from other studies indicate that the information provided by Wikipedia is mostly of high quality but that significant errors and omissions are fairly common.Résumé:Des études antérieures portant sur les articles Wikipédia ont fait mention de résultats inégaux concernant la qualité de l’information sur les sujets liés à la santé. Nous avons étudié l’exactitude des entrées de Wikipédia dans les domaines de la santé, de la nutrition, de la médecine et des médecines parallèles et complémentaires. Nous avons défini trente-deux énoncés qui sont souvent proposés, mais qui sont probablement incorrects (conceptions courantes mais fausses). Une recherche Google a trouvé quarante-trois entrées Wikipédia fournissant des informations sur ces trente-deux énoncés. La plupart des entrées fournissaient des informations exactes, mais nous avons constaté des lacunes dans une minorité d’entre elles. Pour les trente-deux conceptions courantes mais fausses, vingt-trois (72 \%) des entrées Wikipédia atteignaient un degré élevé d’exactitude (dix-neuf avaient un score de 5 [note la plus élevée] et quatre atteignaient 4,5–4,7). Sept des entrées (22\%) atteignaient un score de 4–4,1, ce qui indique que l’entrée comportait une petite erreur ou que des informations essentielles étaient manquantes. Deux entrées atteignaient un score faible (3,5). Sur les quarante-trois entrées de Wikipédia qui ont été évalués quatre atteignaient un score de seulement 3, ce qui indique que l’entrée était soit gravement inexacte soit lacunaire. Ces résultats ainsi que ceux d’autres études indiquent que les informations fournies par Wikipédia sont généralement de haute qualité, mais que des erreurs et des omissions importantes sont assez fréquentes.},

To gain insight into Wikipedia, one asks how initial ideas emerge and develop to become a concrete article through the online collaborative process? Led by this question, the author performed a microscopic observation of the knowledge creation process on the recent article, "Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster." The author collected not only the revision history of the article but also investigated interactions between collaborators by making a user-paragraph network to reveal an intellectual intervention of multiple authors. The knowledge creation process on the Wikipedia article was categorized into 4 major steps and 6 phases from the beginning to the intellectual balance point where only revisions were made. To represent this phenomenon, the author developed a visaphor (digital visual metaphor) to digitally represent the article's evolving concepts and characteristics. Then the author created a dynamic digital information visualization using particle effects and network graph structures. The visaphor reveals the interaction between users and their collaborative efforts as they created and revised paragraphs and debated aspects of the article.},

This study utilized a repeated measures design, wherein all of the participants took the Rorschach twice. The first time all participants completed the Rorschach under normal conditions. The second time all participants completed the Rorschach under the fake good condition, meaning they were motivated to present themselves in a favorable light. Participants in the experimental group were instructed to read the Wikipedia material before taking the test and to use this information to help them fake good. Results indicated that after reading the Wikipedia material, participants' responses demonstrated significantly improved perceptual accuracy (lower FQ-%). However, the overall findings suggested that most of the selected R-PAS variables were not significantly impacted by exposure to the Wikipedia material. All participants had changes in scores on a number of variables when asked to fake good, regardless of whether or not they were exposed to the Wikipedia material. Results indicated that when participants attempted to fake good, they were able to significantly improve markers of affect regulation (lower CF+C/SumC), coping effectiveness (higher MC-PPD), and interpersonal competency (lower PHR/GPHR). They were also likely to give less complex responses (lower Complexity) that were fewer in total number (lower R).

other knowledge bases are based on extracting entity and

hand, is an authoritative and rich source for emerging entities,
events and facts relating to existing entities. In this
work, we study the creation of entities in Wikipedia with
respect to news by studying how entity and event based information
flows from news to Wikipedia.
We analyze the lag of Wikipedia (based on the revision
history of the English Wikipedia) with 20 years of The New
York Times dataset (NYT). We model and analyze the lag of
entities and events, namely their first appearance in Wikipedia
and in NYT, respectively. In our extensive experimental
analysis, we find that almost 20\% of the external
references in entity pages are news articles encoding the importance
of news to Wikipedia. Second, we observe that the
entity-based lag follows a normal distribution with a high
standard deviation, whereas the lag for news-based events is
typically very low. Finally, we find that events are responsible
for creation of emergent entities with as many as 12\%
of the entities mentioned in the event page are created after
the creation of the event page.},

A number of these methods for organization fall into a family defined by word ordering.

While we are interested here in text and have framed our treatment appropriately, our work is potentially applicable to other areas of research (e.g., speech, genomics, and mobility patterns) where one has ordered categorical data, (e.g., sounds, genes, and locations). Our approach focuses on the phrase (whether word or larger) as the primary meaning-bearing lexical unit and object of study. To do so, we employ our previously developed framework for generating word-conserving phrase-frequency data. Upon training our model with the Wiktionary---an extensive, online, collaborative, and open-source dictionary that contains over 100,000 phrasal-definitions---we develop highly effective filters for the identification of meaningful, missing phrase-entries. With our predictions we then engage the editorial community of the Wiktionary and propose short lists of potential missing entries for definition, developing a breakthrough, lexical extraction technique, and expanding our knowledge of the defined English lexicon of phrases.},

Identifying pairs of pages that should be linked may be hard for human editors, especially if the site is large and changes frequently. Further, given a set of useful link candidates, the task of incorporating them into the site can be expensive, since it typically involves humans editing pages. In the light of these challenges, it is desirable to develop data-driven methods for automating the link placement task. Here we develop an approach for automatically finding useful hyperlinks to add to a website. We show that passively collected server logs, beyond telling us which existing links are useful, also contain implicit signals indicating which nonexistent links would be useful if they were to be introduced. We leverage these signals to model the future usefulness of yet nonexistent links. Based on our model, we define the problem of link placement under budget constraints and propose an efficient algorithm for solving it. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by evaluating it on Wikipedia, a large website for which we have access to both server logs (used for finding useful new links) and the complete revision history (containing a ground truth of new links). As our method is based exclusively on standard server logs, it may also be applied to any other website, as we show with the example of the biomedical research site Simtk.},

This growth forces the community to provide tremendous efforts in order to maintain the accuracy and structure of the database. To deal with such amounts of data, Wikipedia users have developed automated programs – bots – to help them to do some of the maintenance tasks. However, it is unclear how human users react to the actions of these bots. Based on a corpus of 6528 interventions (2353 different discussions) of users on talk pages of 50 bots active on English-language Wikipedia pages between January 4, 2012 and January 2, 2013, we analyzed the reactions of users depending of the characteristics of the bots’ actions. Bots activity was strongly associated with the functioning Wikipedia internal community. Bots whose activity was mostly related to the work of other users (e.g. high degree of constraint or visibility) elicited more responses. By combining the different characteristics of the bots, we were able to define two opposite “ideotypes” of bots with distinct behavior: “servant bots” which mainly do repetitive and laborious work instead of human users; and “policing bots” proactively enforcing Wikipedia’s guidelines and norms, which elicited more polarized responses from users (either negative or positive rather than neutral). Our results demonstrated a surprisingly high level of acceptance of bots, modulated by differential reactions in function of the actual behavior of the bots.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: The so-called new media are always a kind of challenge for training supervisors, medical students and doctors-in-training. Especially Wikipedia has a significant position for obtaining important medical information on the internet. Beside many advantages of Wikipedia, there is always the doubt about the correctness of published articles by unknown authors. Therefore the aim of our survey was to investigate the relevance of Wikipedia articles about orthopaedic and traumatological issues in the daily clinical routine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In September 2013 two different questionnaires about medical issues were given to medical students, resident physicians and one medical specialist. The questioning was about diseases/symptoms, examinations/classifications and conservative therapy/surgery of the department of orthopaedics and traumatology. A total of 211 Wikipedia articles were evaluated. Additionally, the participants gave an subjective estimation about these articles.
RESULTS: Overall 134 of 211 separate medical items appeared on Wikipedia. The survey has proven the up-to-dateness of Wikipedia articles and their listing on the first or second position on Google. Wikipedia contains a lot of bibliographical references, high-quality images and video material. Almost half (42,5 \%) of all evaluated articles are appropriate for use in medical exams and in the daily clinical work.
CONCLUSION: First and foremost young resident physicians, the so-called web 2.0 generation, are using the internet for daily work. Maybe the process of learning is developing and changing at the same time. Wikipedia gives the opportunity for everyone to acquire information for free and all over the place. The collaboration of everyone is necessary to improve the quality of medical issues on Wikipedia.},

  abstract   = {The aim of the present study was to critically evaluate the accuracy and readability of English Wikipedia articles on the respiratory system and its disorders and whether they can be a suitable resource for medical students. On April 27, 2014, English Wikipedia was searched for articles on respiratory topics. Using a modified DISCERN instrument, articles were independently scored by three assessors. The scoring targeted content accuracy, frequency of updating, and quality of references. The readability of articles was measured using two other instruments. The mean DISCERN score for the 40 articles identified was 26.4 ± 6.3. Most articles covered causes, signs and symptoms, prevention, and treatment. However, several knowledge deficiencies in the pathogenesis of diseases, investigations needed, and treatment were observed. The total number of references for the 40 articles was 1,654, and the references varied from 0 to 168 references, but several problems were identified in the list of references and citations made. The readability of articles was in the range of 9.4 ± 1.8 to 22.6 ± 10.7 using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level instrument and 10.0 ± 2.6 to 19.6 ± 8.3 using the Readability Coleman-Liau index. A strong correlation was found between the two instruments (r2 = 0.744, P {\textless} 0.001). The agreement between the assessors had mean κ scores in the range of 0.712–0.857. In conclusion, despite the effort placed in creating Wikipedia respiratory articles by anonymous volunteers (wikipedians), most articles had knowledge deficiencies, were not accurate, and were not suitable for medical students as learning resources.},

However, the narrow diversity of the Wikipedia editor community has the potential to introduce systemic biases such as gender biases into the content of Wikipedia. In this paper we aim to tackle a sub problem of this larger challenge by presenting and applying a computational method for assessing gender bias on Wikipedia along multiple dimensions. We find that while women on Wikipedia are covered and featured well in many Wikipedia language editions, the way women are portrayed starkly differs from the way men are portrayed. We hope our work contributes to increasing awareness about gender biases online, and in particular to raising attention to the different levels in which gender biases can manifest themselves on the web.},

In contrast to theories that focus on individuals as actors, the systemic-constructivist approach assumes a top-down perspective. It emphasizes the relevance of social systems and regards the construction of knowledge as a self-referential process that takes place in social systems. We propose that it is the system that defines what is accepted as legitimate knowledge and thus shapes the individuals’ behavior. We present this approach and its implications by providing a case study of knowledge construction in Wikipedia. For this purpose, we employ the Wikipedia article about the nuclear power plant Fukushima-Daiichi. Immediately after the nuclear catastrophe at the plant, the social system Wikipedia had to deal with highly uncertain information regarding the unfolding event and make meaning of this information. The systemic-constructivist perspective directs our attention to the observation that an open group of very diverse people, who largely lacked specific background education on the topic, accomplished the collaborative creation of an article that was later considered by experts to be of high quality. By interpreting these occurrences as operations of a social system, we aim at extending the theoretical basis of the learning sciences with an approach that emphasizes systems and their structures instead of individuals or groups. We discuss how this perspective may contribute to understanding collaborative knowledge construction.},

Instead, peer production projects may conform to Robert Michels' “iron law of oligarchy,” which proposes that democratic membership organizations become increasingly oligarchic as they grow. Using exhaustive data of internal processes from a sample of 683 wikis, we construct empirical measures of participation and test for increases in oligarchy associated with growth  in wikis' contributor bases. In contrast to previous studies, we find support for Michels' iron law and conclude that peer production entails oligarchic organizational forms.},

matched the abstract, a heuristic was applied in which the most likely

To address the linking problem, we cast it into an information retrieval task by treating a given excerpt as a user query with the goal to retrieve a ranked list of relevant news articles. We find that Wikipedia excerpts often come with additional semantics, in their textual descriptions, representing the time, geolocations, and named entities involved in the event. Our retrieval model leverages text and semantic annotations as different dimensions of an event by estimating independent query models to rank documents. In our experiments on two datasets, we compare methods that consider different combinations of dimensions and find that the approach that leverages all dimensions suits our problem best.},

Main focus is on flexibility to the loose schema and configurability towards differing language-editions of Wiktionary. This is achieved by a declarative mediator/wrapper approach. The goal is to allow the addition of languages just by configuration without the need of programming, thus enabling the swift and resource-conserving adaption of wrappers by domain experts. The extracted data is as fine granular as the source data in Wiktionary and additionally follows the lemon model. It enables use cases like disambiguation or machine translation.

However, beyond simple measures of population and economic power, there has been no rigorous quantitative way to define the global influence of languages. Here we use the structure of the networks connecting multilingual speakers and translated texts, as expressed in book translations, multiple language editions of Wikipedia, and Twitter, to provide a concept of language importance that goes beyond simple economic or demographic measures. We find that the structure of these three global language networks (GLNs) is centered on English as a global hub and around a handful of intermediate hub languages, which include Spanish, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, and Chinese. We validate the measure of a language’s centrality in the three GLNs by showing that it exhibits a strong correlation with two independent measures of the number of famous people born in the countries associated with that language. These results suggest that the position of a language in the GLN contributes to the visibility of its speakers and the global popularity of the cultural content they produce.},

  abstract  = {Wikipedia is an open collaboration, global, multilingual project. Its guidelines and policies direct the collaboration process into a vision of objective and neutral encyclopedic knowledge. However, coherence of that knowledge, and the outcomes of the collaborative process on the same topic, can sometimes vary dramatically across different languages. Our goal was to explore what these differences are, and to see how they are contextualized in a case of a contested and conflictive topic. The empirical focus was on the Republic of Kosovo, a recently formed country in Southeast Europe still seeking full international recognition. The study explores the social, cultural and political tensions through following the contextualization of this topic in three different Wikipedia communities: Serbian, Croatian and English. A constructivist (Charmaz, 1998) and substantive grounded theory of the process was created by following a two-step coding process. Three coders were active in different stages of the process. Discussions and comparisons of emergent codes, within and between three different communities, were conducted regularly. The core concept of our theory was neutrality dispute. It is based on four aspects: identities and viewpoints, their input into the process of content editing, relations between the editors, and the process of conflict management. The main drivers of conflict and/or consensus, within and across languages were different types of group identifications in relation to the topic of Kosovo and Wikipedia in general. Wiki software and Wikipedia’s rules help in managing multiple conflicts, although the political and cultural contentiousness of the topic existing in the ˝offline˝ context was also reproduced in the collaborative process.},

For this purpose, we adopt the Analytic Hierarchy Process, a well known methodology for decision making, and we evaluate the maturity degree of more than 24000 Wikipedia medical articles. The obtained results show how the qualitative analysis of medical content not always overlap with a quantitative analysis (an example of which is shown in the paper), since important properties of an article can hardly be synthesized by quantitative features.

We extend prior work about quality of Wikipedia articles, knowledge production, and sources to consider the quality of Wikipedia references. We propose a multidimensional measure of verifiability that takes into account technical accuracy and practical accessibility of sources. We calculate article verifiability scores for a sample of 5,000 articles and 295,800 citations, and compare differently weighted models to illustrate effects of emphasizing particular elements of verifiability over others. We find that, while the quality of references in the overall sample is reasonably high, verifiability varies significantly by article, particularly when emphasizing the use of standard digital identifiers and taking into account the practical availability of referenced sources. We discuss the implications of these findings for measuring verifiability in online information more generally.},

These resources and activities are underpinned by the expectation that students will actively engage in self-directed study (SDS) to enhance their knowledge and understanding of anatomy. To gain insight into preclinical versus clinical medical students' preferences for SDS resources for learning gross anatomy, and whether these vary on demographic characteristics and attitudes toward anatomy, students were surveyed at two Australian medical schools, one undergraduate-entry and the other graduate-entry. Lecture/tutorial/practical notes were ranked first by 33\% of 156 respondents (mean rank ± SD, 2.48 ± 1.38), textbooks by 26\% (2.62 ± 1.35), atlases 20\% (2.80 ± 1.44), videos 10\% (4.34 ± 1.68), software 5\% (4.78 ± 1.50), and websites 4\% (4.24 ± 1.34). Among CAL resources, Wikipedia was ranked highest. The most important factor in selecting CAL resources was cost (ranked first by 46\%), followed by self-assessment, ease of use, alignment with curriculum, and excellent graphics (each 6–9\%). Compared with preclinical students, clinical students ranked software and Acland's Video Atlas of Human Anatomy higher and felt radiological images were more important in selecting CAL resources. Along with other studies reporting on the quality, features, and impact on learning of CAL resources, the diversity of students' preferences and opinions on usefulness and ease of use reported here can help guide faculty in selecting and recommending a range of CAL and other resources to their students to support their self-directed study.

In analyzing this persistent disparity, previous research has focused on aspects of current contributors and the existing Wikipedia community. We draw on unique panel survey data of young adults with information about both Wikipedia contributors and non-contributors. We examine the role of people's background attributes and Internet skills in participation on the site. We find that the gender gap in editing is exacerbated by a similarly significant Internet skills gap. Our results show that the most likely contributors are high-skilled males and that among low-skilled Internet users no gender gap in Wikipedia contributions exists. Our findings suggest that efforts to understand the gender gap must also take Internet skills into account.},

  abstract   = {Hyperlinks are an essential feature of the World Wide Web. They are especially important for online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia: an article can often only be understood in the context of related articles, and hyperlinks make it easy to explore this context. But important links are often missing, and several methods have been proposed to alleviate this problem by learning a linking model based on the structure of the existing links. Here we propose a novel approach to identifying missing links in Wikipedia. We build on the fact that the ultimate purpose of Wikipedia links is to aid navigation. Rather than merely suggesting new links that are in tune with the structure of existing links, our method finds missing links that would immediately enhance Wikipedia's navigability. We leverage data sets of navigation paths collected through a Wikipedia-based human-computation game in which users must find a short path from a start to a target article by only clicking links encountered along the way. We harness human navigational traces to identify a set of candidates for missing links and then rank these candidates. Experiments show that our procedure identifies missing links of high quality.},

In Wikipedia, the “bright line” principle for avoiding a conflict of interest has been that no one should be paid for directly editing an article. By examining the case of Wiki-PR, a consultant firm allegedly involved in helping more than 12,000 clients to edit Wikipedia articles until 2014, the goal of the analysis is to shed light on the paradoxical situation where the institution for supporting the peer production (Wikimedia Foundation) found itself taking a more strict perspective against commercial alliances than the unpaid community editors.},

Every hour, Wikipedia receives thousands of edits, and this brings out some challenges for Wikipedia in antivandalism and content update between language editions. This thesis describes a new approach to enrich Wikipedia contents throughout a model for retrieving, analyzing semantic relations and updating contents. There are three main steps in this model. Firstly, the infobox structures are aligned by matching their properties with Wikidata. This step will provide new infobox structures which adapt with the old ones when the newly added part can be saved in a hidden form in the same templates of origin infoboxes. Next, the system will detect missing interwiki links of articles depending on the new infobox structures by assessing the correlation of semantic relations between the infoboxes in different languages. The last step is to enrich the article content from these semantic relations by interwiki links. Furthermore, semantic relations can also be contributed to Wikidata statements. We can use DBPedia and Wikidata as secondary sources when the system retrieves insufficiently semantic relations of certain articles. We propose to improve the taxonomy and category to be more fine-grained for Wikipedias from the very basic semantic rules. The system will semi-automatically detect and arrange the articles into categories based on English classification. Finally, we apply this model to enrich biological articles with some meaningful and positive results.},

  abstract = {Given that Wikipedia entries are likely to extert a strong influence on how literary texts are perceived - due to their preferential ranking in Google - there is some demand that research dealing with the transfer of knowledge on literature to the public be more concerned with looking into both the content that is available for free on the Web and any aspect that may come with writing about literature for free. This contribution argues from within Wikipedia's multidisciplinary consensus-driven space in which propositional knowledge is given priority that it would be essential for entries on fiction to present non-propositional knowledge as being one of its hallmarks. For this aim, a special concept is developed that is designed to function as the study's formal object: "Erlesnis" (which in German is a pun that combines "Erlebnis" - adventure experience - and "lesen" - reading). It is defined as non-propositional knowledge that has been acquired in an individual reading process. Writing about one's own Erlesnis in new ways is being tried out in four essays, and on de.wikipedia.org an experiment is conducted to find out what community members think about the idea of including, in entries on fiction, sections specifically designed to report about what people felt like when reading a certain text. Finally, a draft typology of Erlesnis-writing is suggested. This contribution is the first of its kind internationally to deal with Wikipedia from the point of view of transfer of knowledge on literature to the public. For the theory of this field of research some new aspects are offered for debate.},

  abstract   = {The successful provision of public goods through mass volunteering over the Internet poses a puzzle to classic social science theories of human cooperation. A solution suggested by recent studies proposes that informal rewards (e.g. a thumbs-up, a badge, an editing award, etc.) can motivate participants by raising their status in the community, which acts as a select incentive to continue contributing. Indeed, a recent study of Wikipedia found that receiving a reward had a large positive effect on the subsequent contribution levels of highly-active contributors. While these findings are suggestive, they only pertained to already highly-active contributors. Can informal rewards also serve as a mechanism to increase participation among less-active contributors by initiating a virtuous cycle of work and reward? We conduct a field experiment on the online encyclopedia Wikipedia in which we bestowed rewards to randomly selected editors of varying productivity levels. Analysis of post-treatment activity shows that despite greater room for less-active contributors to increase their productive efforts, rewards yielded increases in work only among already highly-productive editors. On the other hand, rewards were associated with lower retention of less-active contributors. These findings suggest that the incentive structure in peer production is broadly meritocratic, as highly-active contributors accumulate the most rewards. However, this may also contribute to the divide between the stable core of highly-prodigious producers and a peripheral population of less-active contributors with shorter volunteer tenures.},

Multiple versions of each page can thus co-exist on each repository and across the network, which allows for multiple points of view. Browsing or searching the wiki thus yields multiple page versions; to help the user's page selection process, the system annotates search results with trust indicators based on the distribution of each version in the peer repositories and the topology of the social network. We describe an experimental study where the system was deployed for academic writing exercises, and we analyze the results to validate different aspects of this collaboration principle.

It will enable dynamic data reuse and complex fact queries within the world’s largest knowledge database. Studies of the existing participation patterns that emerge in Wikidata are only just beginning. What delineates most of the contributions in the system has not yet been investigated. Is it an inheritance from the Wikipedia peer-production system or the proximity of tasks in Wikidata that have been studied in collaborative ontology engineering? As a first step to answering this question, we performed a cluster analysis of participants’ content editing activities. This allowed us to blend our results with typical roles found in peer-production and collaborative ontology engineering projects. Our results suggest very specialised contributions from a majority of users. Only a minority, which is the most active group, participate all over the project. These users are particularly responsible for developing the conceptual knowledge of Wikidata. We show the alignment of existing algorithmic participation patterns with these human patterns of participation. In summary, our results suggest that Wikidata rather supports peer-production activities caused by its current focus on data collection. We hope that our study informs future analyses and developments and, as a result, allows us to build better tools to support contributors in peer-production-based ontology engineering.},

We test this model on electoral data drawn from 5 countries in the 2009 and 2014 European Parliament elections, showing that social data does have good potential for predictive accuracy if theoretically informed corrections are applied.},

While identifying low-quality articles with manual efforts is a possible solution, it costs too much manpower and is too time-consuming. In this paper, we utilize article ratings from Wikipedia users for the first time to assess article quality. We define “low-quality” based on those ratings and design automatic methods to identify potential low-quality articles. More specifically, we formulate the problem as a set of binary classification problems and label articles according to whether they are “low-quality”. We compare two baseline algorithms and Logistic Regression algorithm, and the results indicate that it is promising to design effective and efficient automatic solutions for the task.

  abstract  = {Prediction of influenza outbreaks is of utmost importance for health practitioners, officers and people. After the increasing usage of internet, it became easier and more valuable to fetch and process internet search query data. There are two significant platforms that people widely use, Google and Wikipedia. In both platforms, access logs are available which means that we can see how often any query/article was searched. Google has its own web service for monitoring and forecasting influenza-illness which is called the Google Flu Trends. It provides estimates of influenza activity for some countries. The second alternative is Wikipedia access logs which provide the number of visits for the articles on Wikipedia. There are papers which work with these platforms separately. In this paper, we propose a new technique to use these two sources together to improve the prediction of influenza outbreaks. We achieved promising results for both nowcasting and forecasting with linear regression models.},

The description of an entity, composed of property-value pairs (a.k.a. features), has become very large in many applications. To avoid information overload, efforts have been made to automatically select a limited number of features to be shown to the user based on certain criteria, which is called automatic entity summarization. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of extensive studies on how humans rank and select features in practice, which can provide empirical support and inspire future research. In this article, we present a large-scale statistical analysis of the descriptions of entities provided by DBpedia and the abstracts of their corresponding Wikipedia articles, to empirically study, along several different dimensions, which kinds of features are preferable when humans summarize. Implications for automatic entity summarization are drawn from the findings.},

This trend has piqued the attention of scholars, who have considered the permanency concerns raised by citations to Wikipedia and critiqued how courts and advocates have used Wikipedia. This Article adds to the growing scholarship on the Wikipedia citation trend by examining the contours of the Wikipedia contributor crowd and the principles underlying Wikipedia’s content in order to better inform the evaluation of Wikipedia as a potential authoritative source. Part I provides an overview of the Wikipedia citation trend in cases and federal appellate briefs. Part II describes the ongoing judicial and scholarly debate about citation to Wikipedia. Part III first examines the size and demographics of the Wikipedia contributor crowd by using systems data and published surveys. Part III then examines Wikipedia’s editorial and content policies, which guide the Wikipedia contributor crowd in creating content. Finally, Part IV considers the Wikipedia contributor crowd and the editorial and content policies discussed in Part III in the context of traditional evaluative criteria. This evaluation calls into question some of the assumptions underlying the justifications for relying on Wikipedia. Thus, despite the trend, legal writers should proceed with extreme caution when considering reliance on Wikipedia.},

  abstract   = {In order to fight massive vandalism the English-language Wikipedia has developed a system of surveillance which is carried out by humans and bots, supported by various tools. Central to the selection of edits for inspection is the process of using filters or profiles. Can this profiling be justified? On the basis of a careful reading of Frederick Schauer’s books about rules in general (1991) and profiling in particular (2003) I arrive at several conclusions. The effectiveness, efficiency, and risk-aversion of edit selection all greatly increase as a result. The argument for increasing predictability suggests making all details of profiling manifestly public. Also, a wider distribution of the more sophisticated anti-vandalism tools seems indicated. As to the specific dimensions used in profiling, several critical remarks are developed. When patrollers use ‘assisted editing’ tools, severe ‘overuse’ of several features (anonymity, warned before) is a definite possibility, undermining profile efficacy. The easy remedy suggested is to render all of them invisible on the interfaces as displayed to patrollers. Finally, concerning not only assisted editing tools but tools against vandalism generally, it is argued that the anonymity feature is a sensitive category: anons have been in dispute for a long time (while being more prone to vandalism). Targeting them as a special category violates the social contract upon which Wikipedia is based. The feature is therefore a candidate for mandatory ‘underuse’: it should be banned from all anti-vandalism filters and profiling algorithms, and no longer be visible as a special edit trait.},

This collaboration framework was tested with editors of Basque Wikipedia. Their post-editing of Computer Science articles has been used to improve the output of a Spanish to Basque MT system called Matxin. For the collaboration between editors and researchers, we selected a set of 100 articles from the Spanish Wikipedia. These articles would then be used as the source texts to be translated into Basque using the MT engine. A group of volunteers from Basque Wikipedia reviewed and corrected the raw MT translations. This collaboration ultimately produced two main benefits: (i) the change logs that would potentially help improve the MT engine by using an automated statistical post-editing system, and (ii) the growth of Basque Wikipedia. The results show that this process can improve the accuracy of an Rule Based MT (RBMT) system in nearly 10 \% benefiting from the post-edition of 50,000 words in the Computer Science domain. We believe that our conclusions can be extended to MT engines involving other less-resourced languages lacking large parallel corpora or frequently updated lexical knowledge, as well as to other domains.},

which would allow legacy Semantic Web languages, techniques and tools

Wikidata annotates statements with qualifiers and references, which require
some notion of reification to model in RDF. We thus investigate
four such options: (1) standard reification, (2) n-ary relations, (3) singleton
properties, and (4) named graphs. Taking a recent dump of Wikidata,
we generate the four RDF datasets pertaining to each model and discuss
high-level aspects relating to data sizes, etc. To empirically compare the
effect of the different models on query times, we collect a set of benchmark
queries with four model-specific versions of each query. We present
the results of running these queries against five popular SPARQL implementations:
4store, BlazeGraph, GraphDB, Jena TDB and Virtuoso.},

  abstract  = {Diese Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Frage nach einer situationsrelativen Informations-rezeption im Information Retrieval im Allgemeinen und bei der Suche in der deutsch-sprachigen Wikipedia im Speziellen. Motiviert wurde das Forschungsdesiderat vor allem durch die schnell ansteigenden Datenmengen und die damit verbundenen Selek-tionsschwierigkeiten durch den Nutzer sowie weiter durch die Informationssuche als Beschäftigung des alltäglichen Lebens.
Die Arbeit ist dabei in zwei Teile untergliedert. Im theoretischen Teil werden zunächst die Komplexität der möglichen Suchsituationen und der Einfluss subjektiver Kompo-nenten auf die Bewertung von Informationen besprochen. Auf dieser Basis wurde an-schließend das situationsabhängige Suchverhalten in der deutschsprachigen Wikipedia untersucht.
In zwei unabhängigen Studien kamen ergänzend explizite (Fragebögen) und implizite (Eyetracking) Methoden zum Einsatz, die ermöglichten, die subjektiven Bewertungen der Inhalte durch den Nutzer zu protokollieren. In beiden Studien konnte gezeigt wer-den, dass die Suchsituation, hier vor allem im Sinne des Grads der Definiertheit und der Endlichkeit des Suchziels, sowohl Suchstrategie und Informationsrezeption beein-flussen, als auch die Wünsche der Suchenden nach bestimmten Inhaltsstrukturen. Wei-ter bestätigten die Untersuchungen, dass die Zufriedenheit der Nutzer nicht nur von einem inhaltlichen Sucherfolg abhängt, sondern auch stark mit einer jeweils angemes-senen Informationspräsentation korreliert. In Zusammenfassung der eigenen Studien und der Ergebnisse, die der aktuellen Forschungsliteratur entnommen wurden, kam diese Arbeit zu dem Schluss, dass die Situation des Nutzers, bestehend aus einer Viel-zahl an Komponenten, an verschiedenen Stellen einen messbaren Einfluss auf die In-formationsrezeption des Nutzers beim Information Retrieval in der deutschsprachigen Wikipedia hat.},

Recent academic research and popular discourse illustrates the often aggressive ways newcomers are treated by veteran Wikipedians. These are complex sociotechnical issues, bound up in infrastructures based on problematic ideologies. In response, we worked with a coalition of Wikipedians to design, develop, and deploy Snuggle, a new user interface that served two critical functions: making the work of newcomer socialization more effective, and bringing visibility to instances in which Wikipedians? current practice of gatekeeping socialization breaks down. Snuggle supports positive socialization by helping mentors quickly find newcomers whose good-faith mistakes were reverted as damage. Snuggle also supports ideological critique and reflection by bringing visibility to the consequences of viewing newcomers through a lens of suspiciousness.},

Finally, what does matter to be promoted? being a good contributor? being a good animator? knowing the boss? We explore this question looking at the process of election for administrator in the English Wikipedia community. We modeled the candidates according to their revisions and/or social attributes. These attributes are used to construct a predictive model of promotion success, based on the candidates's past behavior, computed thanks to a random forest algorithm. Our model combining knowledge contribution variables and social networking variables successfully explain 78\% of the results which is better than the former models. It also helps to refine the criterion for election. If the number of knowledge contributions is the most important element, social interactions come close second to explain the election. But being connected with the future peers (the admins) can make the difference between success and failure, making this epistemic community a very social community too.},

I exploit exogenous variation in the article network of German Wikipedia to circumvent this problem. Wikipedia prominently advertises one featured article on its main site every day, which increases viewership of the advertised article. Shifts in the viewership of adjacent articles are due to their link from the treated article. Through this approach I isolate how the link network causally influences users' search and contribution behavior. I use a difference-in-differences analysis to estimate how attention spills to neighbors through the transient shock of advertisement. I further develop an extended peer effects model which relaxes the requirement of an exogenously given network. This model enables the estimation of the underlying spillover. Advertisements affect neighboring articles substantially: Their viewership increases by almost 70 percent. This, in turn, translates to increased editing activity. Attention is the driving mechanism behind views and short edits. Both outcomes are related to the order of links, while more substantial edits are not.},

In this paper we study the different types of links in Wikipedia, and contrast the use of the full graph with respect to just direct links. We apply a well-known random walk algorithm on two tasks, word relatedness and named-entity disambiguation. We show that using the full graph is more effective than just direct links by a large margin, that non-reciprocal links harm performance, and that there is no benefit from categories and infoboxes, with coherent results on both tasks. We set new state-of-the-art figures for systems based on Wikipedia links, comparable to systems exploiting several information sources and/or supervised machine learning. Our approach is open source, with instruction to reproduce results, and amenable to be integrated with complementary text-based methods.},

Second, the benefits of teaching with Wikipedia for educators, students, and the wider society, as discussed in the current teaching literature, are explored.

References are made to the legal positions in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. I argue that users of social media sites are subject to the mixed signals given by social media sites, as a result of which they are unfairly exposed to the risks of allegations of copyright infringement.

In this paper, we present a case study of the 2014 Winter Olympics, where we tell the story of breaking news events in the context of the Olympics with the help of social multimedia stemming from multiple social network sites. Therefore, we have extended the application Wikipedia Live Monitor-a tool for the detection of breaking news events-with the capability of automatically creating media galleries that illustrate events. Athletes winning an Olympic competition, a new country leading the medal table, or simply the Olympics themselves are all events newsworthy enough for people to concurrently edit Wikipedia and Wikidata-around the world in many languages. The Olympics being an event of common interest, an even bigger majority of people share the event in a multitude of languages on global social network sites, which makes the event an ideal subject of study. With this work, we connect the world of Wikipedia and Wikidata with the world of social network sites, in order to convey the spirit of the 2014 Winter Olympics, to tell the story of victory and defeat, and always following the Olympic motto Citius, Altius, Fortius. The proposed system-generalized for all sort of breaking news stories-has been put in production in form of the Twitter bot @mediagalleries, available and archived at https://twitter.com/mediagalleries.},

  abstract = {Online open collaboration efforts, such as Wikipedia articles and open source software development, often involve a large crowd with diverse experiences and interests. Diversity, on the one hand, facilitates the access to and integration of a wide variety of information; on the other hand, it may cause conflict and hurt group performance. Although diversity’s effects have been the subject of many studies in offline work groups (with the results remaining inconclusive), its effects in online self-organizing groups are underexplored. In this paper, we examine 648 WikiProjects to understand (1) how tenure disparity and interest variety affect group productivity and member withdrawal and (2) how the two types of diversity evolve over time. Our results show a curvilinear effect of tenure disparity, which increases productivity and decreases member withdrawal, up to a point. Beyond that point, productivity slightly decreases, and members are more likely to withdraw. In comparison, our results show a positive effect of interest variety on productivity and no significant effects on withdrawal. We also find that, over a project’s life cycle, tenure disparity decreases and interest variety increases, with both converging toward the level that is optimal for group performance. Overall, our study highlights the importance of having diverse experiences and perspectives in online open collaboration and the power of self-organizing that helps groups evolve toward their high-performing zones. It also has practical implications on the design of collaboration tools and new forms of organizing work in traditional organizations.

  abstract   = {In this article, we first argue the importance and timely need of linking libraries and Wikipedia for improving the quality of their services to information consumers, as such linkage will enrich the quality of Wikipedia articles and at the same time increase the visibility of library resources which are currently overlooked to a large degree. We then describe the development of an automatic system for subject indexing of library metadata records with Wikipedia concepts as an important step towards library–Wikipedia integration. The proposed system is based on first identifying all Wikipedia concepts occurring in the metadata elements of library records. This is then followed by training and deploying generic machine learning algorithms to automatically select those concepts which most accurately reflect the core subjects of the library materials whose records are being indexed. We have assessed the performance of the developed system using standard information retrieval measures of precision, recall and F-score on a dataset consisting of 100 library metadata records manually indexed with a total of 469 Wikipedia concepts. The evaluation results show that the developed system is capable of achieving an averaged F-score as high as 0.92.},

For example, it provides plot, cast, and production information about a given movie, but not showing times in your local movie theatre. Here we describe how we can connect local information to Wikipedia, without altering its content. The case study we present involves finding local scientific experts. Using a third-party taxonomy, independent from Wikipedia's category hierarchy, we index information connected to our local experts, present in their activity reports, and we re-index Wikipedia content using the same taxonomy. The connections between Wikipedia pages and local expert reports are stored in a relational database, accessible through as public SPARQL endpoint. A Wikipedia gadget (or plugin) activated by the interested user, accesses the endpoint as each Wikipedia page is accessed. An additional tab on the Wikipedia page allows the user to open up a list of teams of local experts associated with the subject matter in the Wikipedia page. The technique, though presented here as a way to identify local experts, is generic, in that any third party taxonomy, can be used in this to connect Wikipedia to any non-Wikipedia data source.},

Translated articles are indexed for both title and content, and integrated with original Danish articles where they exist.
Changed or added articles in the Swedish Wikipedia are monitored and added on a daily basis. The translation
approach uses a grammar-based machine translation system with a deep source-language structural analysis.
Disambiguation and lexical transfer rules exploit Constraint Grammar tags and dependency links to access contextual
information, such as syntactic argument function, semantic type and quantifiers. Out-of-vocabulary words are handled
by derivational and compound analysis with a combined coverage of 99.3\%, as well as systematic morpho-phonemic
transliterations for the remaining cases. The system achieved BLEU scores of 0.65-0.8 depending on references and
outperformed both STMT and RBMT competitors by a large margin.},

  abstract   = {The sparse nature of Wikipedia’s main content interface, dominated by clearly laid out content, neatly organized into information boxes, and structured into headings and subheadings projects an image of a simple and flexible content management system. Even though the process of social production that undergirds Wikipedia is rife with conflict, power struggles, revert wars, content transactions, and coordination efforts, not to mention vandalism, the article pages on Wikipedia shun information gauges that highlight the social nature of the contributions. Rather, they are characterized by a “less is more” ideology of design, which aims to maximize readability and to encourage future contributions. The tools for discerning the social dynamics that lead to the creation of any given page are buried deep into the structure of the interface. Often they are created and maintained by voluntary contributors, who host the information on their own servers. The reason for which the design choices made for the Wikipedia interface hide rather than highlight the true nature of these social dynamics remains a continuous motive for puzzlement. Closer investigation reveals that the deceivingly simple nature of the interface is in fact a method to attract new collaborators and to establish content credibility. As Wikipedia has matured, its public notoriety demands a new approach to the manner in which Wikipedia reflects the rather complex process of authorship on its content pages. This chapter discusses a number of visualizations designed to support this goal, and discusses why they have not as yet been adopted into the Wikipedia interface. The ultimate aim of the chapter is to highlight that in an era of socially constructed knowledge the debate about the desirability of visualizing the process by which knowledge is produced on social media should be about more than “responsive interfaces” and maximizing contributions. The ethical implications of knowing who is responsible for producing the content are important and should be made visible in collaborative knowledge production projects.},

The authors argue that Wikipedia (yes, Wikipedia) provides a unique platform for improving learning outcomes and a useful social good from traditional student papers on elections. The proposed lesson plan can achieve this in at least three ways: (1) by providing social incentives for learning and a method for students to contribute to social science knowledge from their earliest courses, the incorporation of Wikipedia editing can improve student learning and retention; (2) incorporating an online information component can help both future students and researchers by improving the quality and quantity of easily accessible and well-referenced information about historical and upcoming elections; and (3) the use of the Wiki format is becoming increasingly common in both business and government. Teaching the basics of editing is an increasingly useful skill for students to learn for future employment.},

This study aims to check if Wikipedia’s ratings really reflect its stated criteria. According to Wikipedia criteria, having abundant and stable content is the key to article’s quality promotion; we therefore examine the content change in terms of quantity change and content stability by showing the semantic convergence. We found out that the quantity of content change is significant in the promoted articles, which complies with Wikipedia’s stated criteria.},

After a statistical process, it is seen that there is a Darwinian Explanation for the evolution of Dialectal Languages all over the world and as the Arabic Countries are close to Rome in Italy, the original city of Latin Letters, the rate of Dialectal Projects in Wikimedia Translations is little not because of the lack of Fit of non-Latin and particularly Semitic Languages to Latin Letters but because of the fact that the experience of the use of Latin Letters to write the Arabic Dialects is quite new. So, this experience should be developed so that the letters that do not have Standard Latin Equivalent Letters could be transcripted used a new version of sTUNdard Latin Writing and so that the sTUNdard new version can fit to the combination of vowels and sounds used in Tunisian Arabic. To do this development, sTUNdard developers can refer to Pinyin, French and Italian Experiences in that.},

In order to understand this, scholars have analyzed Wikipedia using current metrics like user session and activity.

We describe a methodology for identifying clusters of user activity and argue that regularity with which these activity clusters appear implies a good rule-of-thumb inactivity threshold of about 1 hour.

  title    = {Using {Wikipedia} page views to explore the cultural importance of global reptiles},
  journal  = {Biological Conservation},
  abstract = {Modern conservation operates at the nexus of biological and social influences. While the importance of social and cultural factors is often mentioned, defining, measuring and comparing these factors remains a significant challenge. Here, we explore a novel method to quantify cultural interest in all extant reptile species using Wikipedia — a large, open-access online encyclopaedia. We analysed all page views of reptile species viewed during 2014 in all of Wikipedia's language editions. We compared species' page view numbers across languages and in relationship to their spatial distribution, phylogeny, threat status and various other biological attributes. We found that the three species with most page views are shared across major language editions, beyond these, page view ranks of species tend to be specific to particular language editions. Interest within a language is mostly focused on reptiles found in the regions where the language is spoken. Overall, interest is greater for reptiles that are venomous, endangered, widely distributed, larger and that have been described earlier. However, within individual reptile families not all the above factors predict page views. Most families contain at least one species in the top 5\% of page views, but 29 families (with 1,450 species) have no ‘high interest species’ in them. Overall, our analyses elucidate novel patterns of human interests in nature over large geographical, cultural and taxonomic spectra using big-data techniques. Such approaches hold much promise for incorporating social perceptions in future conservation practices.},

  abstract = {The Wikipedia project has created one of the largest and best-known open knowledge communities. This community is a model for several similar efforts, both public and commercial, and even for the knowledge economy of the future e-society. For these reasons, issues of quality, social processes, and motivation within the Wikipedia knowledge community have attracted attention of researchers. Research has often used Social Network Analysis applied to networks created based on behavioral data available from the edit history of the Wikipedia.

This paper asks the following question: are the popular assumptions about the social interpretations of networks created from the edit history valid? We verify commonly assumed interpretations of four types of networks created from discussions on Wikipedia talk pages, co-edits and reverts in Wikipedia articles, and edits of articles in various topics, by comparing these networks with results from a survey of editors of the Polish Wikipedia community. The results indicate that while the behavioral networks are strongly related to the declarations of respondents, only in one case of the network created from talk pages and interpreted as acquaintance we can observe a near equivalence. The article next describes improved definitions of behavioral indicators obtained through machine learning. The improved networks are much closer to their declarative counterparts.

The main contribution of the article is a validated model of an acquaintance network among Wikipedia editors that can be derived from behavioral data and validly interpreted as acquaintance. Other contributions are improved versions of behavioral networks based on editing behavior and discussion history on the Wikipedia.},

  abstract = {Since the late twentieth century, open source software projects—the GNU/Linux operating system, the Apache web server, Perl and many others—have achieved phenomenal success. This success can be attributed to a new paradigm of productivity in which individuals voluntarily collaborate to produce knowledge, goods and services. Benkler claims this productivity paradigm is a “new, third mode of production” particularly suited for “the digitally networked environment” (2002). Labeled “peer production,” this paradigm contrasts with market and managerial hierarchies. In addition to open source projects, the peer production model, in different forms, has been used in areas such as science/citizen science (Silvertown, 2009), library science (Weinberger, 2007), politics (Castells, 2007; Jenkins, 2006), education (Daniel, 2012), journalism (Gillmor, 2004), and culture (Jenkins, 2006; Lessig, 2004).

As peer production has flourished, merely describing successful cases has become less useful. Instead, scholars must identify the dynamics, structures, and conditions that contribute to or impede that success. Toward that end, this dissertation combines theoretical approaches in organization science with in-depth empirical analysis on a range of peer production projects to examine the mechanisms that underlie their success. Specifically, I examine three management challenges, at three levels, that impede the success of peer production: the individual level challenge, the practice level challenge and the community level challenge.

The contributions of my dissertation are twofold. For scholars in organizational studies, my dissertation advances the understanding of non-bureaucratic, dynamic, flat and informal peer production systems. For practitioners, my dissertation offers practical advice to build more effective and successful peer production projects.},

select the most preferred content from a web page. In our view, the

Linked open data provide a wealth of knowledge that can be associated with street names, enabling novel ways to explore cultural geographies. This paper presents a three-fold contribution. We present (1) a technique to establish a correspondence between street names and the entities that they refer to. The method is based on Wikidata, a knowledge base derived from Wikipedia. The accuracy of this mapping is evaluated on a sample of streets in Rome. As this approach reaches limited coverage, we propose to tap local knowledge with (2) a simple web platform. Users can select the best correspondence from the calculated ones or add another entity not discovered by the automated process. As a result, we design (3) an enriched OpenStreetMap web map where each street name can be explored in terms of the properties of its associated entity. Through several filters, this tool is a first step towards the interactive exploration of toponymy, showing how open data can reveal facets of the cultural texture that pervades places.},

Much effort has been devoted to generating and enriching the structured data by automatic information extraction from unstructured text in Wikipedia. Most, if not all, of the existing work share the same paradigm, that is, starting with information extraction over the unstructured text data, followed by supervised machine learning. Although remarkable progresses have been made, this paradigm has its own limitations in terms of effectiveness, scalability as well as the high labeling cost. We present WiiCluster, a scalable platform for automatically generating infobox for articles in Wikipedia. The heart of our system is an effective cluster-then-label algorithm over a rich set of semi-structured data in Wikipedia articles: linked entities. It is totally unsupervised and thus does not require any human label. It is effective in generating semantically meaningful summarization for Wikipedia articles. We further propose a cluster-reuse algorithm to scale up our system. Overall, our WiiCluster is able to generate nearly 10 million new facts. We also develop a web-based platform to demonstrate WiiCluster, which enables the users to access and browse the generated knowledge.},

  abstract = {Open biological data are distributed over many resources making them challenging to integrate, to update and to disseminate quickly. Wikidata is a growing, open community database which can serve this purpose and also provides tight integration with Wikipedia. In order to improve the state of biological data, facilitate data management and dissemination, we imported all human and mouse genes, and all human and mouse proteins into Wikidata. In total, 59 721 human genes and 73 355 mouse genes have been imported from NCBI and 27 306 human proteins and 16 728 mouse proteins have been imported from the Swissprot subset of UniProt. As Wikidata is open and can be edited by anybody, our corpus of imported data serves as the starting point for integration of further data by scientists, the Wikidata community and citizen scientists alike. The first use case for these data is to populate Wikipedia Gene Wiki infoboxes directly from Wikidata with the data integrated above. This enables immediate updates of the Gene Wiki infoboxes as soon as the data in Wikidata are modified. Although Gene Wiki pages are currently only on the English language version of Wikipedia, the multilingual nature of Wikidata allows for usage of the data we imported in all 280 different language Wikipedias. Apart from the Gene Wiki infobox use case, a SPARQL endpoint and exporting functionality to several standard formats (e.g. JSON, XML) enable use of the data by scientists.
In summary, we created a fully open and extensible data resource for human and mouse molecular biology and biochemistry data. This resource enriches all the Wikipedias with structured information and serves as a new linking hub for the biological semantic web.

we implemented on a Wiki talk page (1) visual controversy
status highlights as implicit guidance and (2) a

Moreover, repositories and websites, including ArXiv and Wikipedia, and growing numbers of digital libraries use these structural formats to present mathematical formulae. This presents an important new and challenging area of research, namely Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we propose WikiMirs, a tool to facilitate mathematical formula retrieval in Wikipedia. WikiMirs is aimed at searching for similar mathematical formulae based upon both textual and spatial similarities, using a new indexing and matching model developed for layout structures. A hierarchical generalization technique is proposed to generate sub-trees from presentation trees of mathematical formulae, and similarity is calculated based upon matching at different levels of these trees. Experimental results show that WikiMirs can efficiently support sub-structure matching and similarity matching of mathematical formulae. Moreover, WikiMirs obtains both higher accuracy and better ranked results over Wikipedia in comparison to Wikipedia Search and Egomath. We conclude that WikiMirs provides a new, alternative, and hopefully better service for users to search mathematical expressions within Wikipedia.},

  abstract  = {Algunas tecnologías parecen cambiar de manera inevitable las sociedades en las 
que son usadas. Las tecnologías de la información hacen esto de forma muy interesante. 
La imprenta es una de estas tecnologías. Al difundirse por Europa el uso de la imprenta 
la facilidad y utilidad de la lectura creció de tal manera que empezaron a surgir 
problemas. Había un exceso de información de entre la cual a menudo era difícil extraer 
la información pertinente para un momento dado. No resultaba fácil transformar 
rápidamente esta información excesiva en conocimiento realmente útil. Una de 
las posibles soluciones a este problema, fue la enciclopedia. La versión de Diderot  
y d'Alembert fue un reflejo de la Ilustración Europea.  
 
Wikipedia es la enciclopedia más usada hoy día, además de ser una de las páginas 
web más frecuentadas. Forma parte de la naturaleza de las enciclopedias el organizar 
y preparar información para su uso, son empleadas como fuentes rápidas y fiables de 
conocimiento. Al estudiar el desarrollo y la estructura de Wikipedia, comparándola 
con otras influyentes enciclopedias a partir de la Ilustración, se pretende descubrir 
las distintas maneras en las que el conocimiento es usado y comprendido en la actualidad 
por el público general.},

Nadalje, nastavnici Wikipediju češće koriste za potrebe nastave nego u kontekstu znanstveno- istraživačkog rada, a studenti Wikipediju koriste u većoj mjeri zbog lakoće pronalaženja informacija nego zbog kvalitetnih i pouzdanih članaka.

Social media has a part to play in this, with sites such as Facebook and Twitter gaining visibility and traction as ‘must-have’ tools for public diplomacy 2.0. This article casts light on the less visible but pervasive social media platform of Wikipedia. Taking a case-study approach, the article posits that Wikipedia holds a dual relevance for public diplomacy 2.0: first as a medium; and second, as a model for public diplomacy’s evolving process. Exploring Wikipedia’s folksonomy, crowd-sourced through intense and organic collaboration, provides insights into the potential of collective agency and symbolic advocacy. The article’s findings highlight the limitations within current approaches towards public diplomacy 2.0, and offer new approaches for public diplomacy’s more progressive agenda.},

time. Time dependence of number of biographical pages related to a year has a broken linear
trend in logarithmic scale. It shows a sudden change of the slope from 0.0006 to 0.008 per
year near 1700 AC. Presumably, this reflects the emergence of new ways of information
dissemination associated with printing of books and newspapers. Cultural or historical
significance of a person is measured using a number of proper Wikipedia references. We
divided human activity into nine categories using keyword search. They cover over 97\%
of the extracted data. Time dependencies of shares of each category reveal evolution of
priorities or interests of mankind. Finally, categories were merged in just two classes. We
call them Personal and Public, introducing a new index of human priorities as a ratio of
Personal to Public. Being quite constant during almost the entire history, the index shows
a sharp jump at the end of the 20th century mainly due to growth of Sport and Art groups
over all others. We consider this as a kind of revolution},

The Wikipedia ranking of top 100 universities provides about 60 percent overlap with the Shanghai university ranking demonstrating the reliable features of this approach.

Yet, this scholarship has not considered the implications of Wikipedia's “gender gap”—the highly disproportionate number of male editors over female editors. In this article, I explore how Wikipedia functions as a rhetorical discourse community whose conventions exclude and silence feminist ways of knowing and writing. Drawing on textual analysis of Wikipedia's editorial policies, as well as interviews with female users, I argue that Wikipedia's insistence on separating embodied subjectivity from the production of knowledge limits the site's ability to facilitate any substantial, subversive feminist rhetorical action. These limitations, I suggest, should inform a critical pedagogical approach to Wikipedia.},

Doing so, the amount of online search engine queries is treated as a valid indicator of the public agenda because recipients might search for those issues they find especially relevant. This article, first, approaches this question from a theoretical perspective. Second, a time-series analysis is done comparing the amount of the coverage of eleven online media on the EHEC pandemic in summer 2011 and the amount of page requests for articles in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia relevant to EHEC. Overall, analyses show strong correlations but also temporary discrepancies, appearing because page requests do not only depict the public agenda but also existing uncertainty about an issue.},

Da Wissen in der heutigen Gesellschaft eine zu-nehmend wichtigere Ressource darstellt, ist so vielen Menschen wie möglich der Zugang zu Wissen zu ermöglichen. Während die Transferwissenschaft der Umsetzung dieses Postulats und den damit in Zusammenhang stehenden Barrieren wissenschaftstheoretisch auf den Grund geht, setzt die freie Online-Enzyklopädie Wikipedia die globale und allgemeinver-ständliche Verbreitung von Wissen in die Praxis um. Die übergeordnete Fragestellung lautet, inwieweit der auf der Wikipedia stattfindende intra- und interlinguale Wissenstransfer tat-sächlich gelingt. Für die Beurteilung des intralingualen Wissenstransfers werden zwei Artikel zum selben Lemma anhand der Textverständlichkeitskriterien von Jahr und Göpferich sowie der zwölf Prinzipien des Wissenstransfers von Antos analysiert. Die Beurteilung des interlin-gualen Wissenstransfers erfolgt mittels einer an Nords Textanalyse angelehnten Überset-zungsanalyse von japanischen Wikipedia-Artikeln und ihren englischen Ausgangstexten.
Mittels eines Fragebogens wurde festgestellt, dass der Großteil der auf der Wikipedia übersetzerisch tätigen Personen über keine professionelle Ausbildung verfügt. Da die Ein-schätzung der Qualität der Translate nur unter Einbeziehung der Laienkompetenz der Über-setzenden möglich ist, werden die Ergebnisse der Übersetzungsanalyse und jene des Frage-bogens miteinander in Beziehung gesetzt. Es zeigt sich, dass der auf der Wikipedia stattfin-dende Wissenstransfer durchaus gelingt, wobei die intralinguale Aufbereitung des wissen-schaftlichen Wissens die Qualität des interlingualen Transfers bedingt. In beiden Fällen ist die Qualität stark von den Fähigkeiten der vermittelnden bzw. übersetzenden Personen abhängig, weshalb das Konzept des gemeinschaftlichen Arbeitens der Artikelqualität äußerst zuträglich ist. Zudem wird gezeigt, dass Transferwissenschaft und Translationswissenschaft über viele Gemeinsamkeiten in Theorie und Praxis verfügen und stark von einer engeren Zu-sammenarbeit profitieren könnten.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach to person name disambiguation and linking that uses a large-scale social network extracted from the English Wikipedia. First, possible candidate matches for an ambiguous person name are determined. With each candidate match, a network substructure is associated. Based on the similarity between these network substructures and the latent network of an ambiguous person name in a document, we propose an efficient ranking method to resolve the ambiguity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, resulting in an overall precision of over 96\% for disambiguating person names and linking them to real world entities.},

Wikipedia, often considered not as reliable as scholarly articles, continues to be popular. Rutgers librarians conducted a Wikipedia project to improve its content to benefit students. The importance of cultural competency in health care is widely recognized due to increasingly diverse patient populations. Medical schools integrate cultural competency in curricula to train students to be culturally competent. Therefore, this topic was chosen for the Wikipedia Project. It is hoped that health sciences librarians and educators will benefit from their experience.},

From small groups of individuals negotiating article changes on “talk pages”, to the involvement of hundreds of people in the formation of the community consensuses needed to implement new policies, to the use of binding arbitration to create final conflict resolutions, the Wikipedia community has developed a complex network of norms and rules that funnel all disagreements and intractable differences through a series of progressively more involved dispute resolution processes. I provide an overview and analysis of the dispute resolution processes used by the community and will look to the successes and limitation of these processes. A number of flaws will be identified including the ability for vocal minorities to dominate the Wikipedia community consensus. A systemic bias will be identified in the behavioural landscape of the community and, finally, it will become apparent that there is room for growth in the website’s inclusiveness, primarily through addressing the logistical realities of a potential user’s access to the time, materials, and knowledge needed to become a contributing member of the Wikipedia community.},

With the help of the French Wikimédia Foundation, we have invited Wikipedia community to participate (through the questionnaire), to a simulation exercise of a dictator game (DG). This procedure, standard in the experimental economics literature, has been conducted here on a very large scale, since the number of persons who completed the whole questionnaire amounts to more than 13,000. This has provided us with a huge sample, and has given statistically relevant evidence on the way people abide or not by some sorts of social norms. We have also shown that both contributors and non contributors adhere to this norm, and that it is correlated to the “patronage” of Wikipedia, as those who often use the encyclopedia, or have been using it for several years, or declare a strong attachment to it, are more willing to choose the 50/50 split in the DG. Using the method of instrumental variable to identify the causal relationship between the equal split and the involvement in Wikipedia does not invalidate the assumption that choosing the equal split in the DG is led by the involvement in the Wikipedia.},

  abstract = {Finding experts to review a submission or to collaborate with an industry partner is a common problem in the research enterprise that is typically solved manually or by word of mouth. Services like LinkedIn rely on the experts themselves to keep their profiles updated, or the system asks their friends to confirm areas of expertise. The focus of this thesis is on the automatic extraction of expertise representations from the experts' publications, which could be used in a variety of applications such as paper assignment to reviewers in  conferences, automatic profile tagging and personalized article recommendation systems.  
We are representing expertise areas by a set of computer science research topics defined by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). Each topic is described by a number of keyterms related to different aspects of that topic. We model representing expertise areas of a researcher as a classification problem, where classes are NSERC research topics and instances are researchers. The input of this classifier is a set of features extracted from papers of a researcher and the output is her expertise areas.  
To model a researcher, we extract important keyterms from the title and abstract of papers and then find their corresponding concepts and categories in Wikipedia. Keyterm is a word n-gram that explicitly appears in the text. While concepts and categories are the intended meaning of each keyterm without ambiguity. We extract concepts and categories from Wikipedia using different tools like Wikipedia Miner and Sunflower.  
We represent documents associated with researchers and research topics in three ways: bag of words, bag of concepts and bag of categories. We calculate the lexical and semantic similarities between a researcher and an NSERC research topic using different methods and use them as input features of the classifier. Then using a labeled dataset first we train our classification model and then test its performance in terms of precision and recall. 
Evaluation of this task is not trivial since labeled training data is not readily available. We train and evaluate the system using authors created by gathering conference papers that are on different research topics. We predict the research topic of each author and measure the prediction performance.},

Perhaps this is only my perception, but it appeared that Wikipedia was used as a defenseless punching bag in much information literacy instruction. The refrain was always “don’t use Wikipedia” or “don’t use Google” to the neglect of far worse research sources like Yahoo! Answers. This “traditional” stance of librarianship was that the community-edited encyclopedia failed any quality analysis due to its sketchy authority; “anyone can edit”—anonymously even!—and therefore its content cannot possibly be trusted. Instructors would even develop assignments wherein students would vandalize the encyclopedia, deliberately inserting inaccurate or incoherent content, to demonstrate its unreliability. Leaving ethics aside, such assignments are constructed to ignore the finely tuned “bots” (editing programs which constantly crawl the site looking for clear signs of mischief) and diligent editors working to remove such content.},

  abstract   = {The online resource Wikipedia is increasingly used by students for knowledge acquisition and learning. However, the lack of a formal editorial review and the heterogeneous expertise of contributors often results in skepticism by educators whether Wikipedia should be recommended to students as an information source. In this study we systematically analyzed the accuracy and completeness of drug information in the German and English language versions of Wikipedia in comparison to standard textbooks of pharmacology. In addition, references, revision history and readability were evaluated. Analysis of readability was performed using the Amstad readability index and the Erste Wiener Sachtextformel. The data on indication, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects and contraindications for 100 curricular drugs were retrieved from standard German textbooks of general pharmacology and compared with the corresponding articles in the German language version of Wikipedia. Quantitative analysis revealed that accuracy of drug information in Wikipedia was 99.7\%±0.2\% when compared to the textbook data. The overall completeness of drug information in Wikipedia was 83.8±1.5\% (p{\textless}0.001). Completeness varied in-between categories, and was lowest in the category “pharmacokinetics” (68.0\%±4.2\%; p{\textless}0.001) and highest in the category “indication” (91.3\%±2.0\%) when compared to the textbook data overlap. Similar results were obtained for the English language version of Wikipedia. Of the drug information missing in Wikipedia, 62.5\% was rated as didactically non-relevant in a qualitative re-evaluation study. Drug articles in Wikipedia had an average of 14.6±1.6 references and 262.8±37.4 edits performed by 142.7±17.6 editors. Both Wikipedia and textbooks samples had comparable, low readability. Our study suggests that Wikipedia is an accurate and comprehensive source of drug-related information for undergraduate medical education.},

Our experimental evaluation, which uses Freebase as reference KG, reveals we can augment several relations in the domain of people by more than 10\%, with facts whose accuracy are over 95\%.

At the same time there is concern that these collaborations are threatened by high levels of member turnover. In this paper we borrow ideas from topic analysis to editor activity on Wikipedia over time into a latent space that offers an insight into the evolving patterns of editor behavior. This latent space representation reveals a number of different categories of editor (e.g. content experts, social networkers) and we show that it does provide a signal that predicts an editor's departure from the community. We also show that long term editors gradually diversify their participation by shifting edit preference from one or two namespaces to multiple namespaces and experience relatively soft evolution in their editor profiles, while short term editors generally distribute their contribution randomly among the namespaces and experience considerably fluctuated evolution in their editor profiles.},

  abstract   = {Automatic quality evaluation of Web information is a task with many fields of applications and of great relevance, especially in critical domains like the medical one. We move from the intuition that the quality of content of medical Web documents is affected by features related with the specific domain. First, the usage of a specific vocabulary (Domain Informativeness); then, the adoption of specific codes (like those used in the infoboxes of Wikipedia articles) and the type of document (e.g., historical and technical ones). In this paper, we propose to leverage specific domain features to improve the results of the evaluation of Wikipedia medical articles. In particular, we evaluate the articles adopting an "actionable" model, whose features are related to the content of the articles, so that the model can also directly suggest strategies for improving a given article quality. We rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and dictionaries-based techniques in order to extract the bio-medical concepts in a text. We prove the effectiveness of our approach by classifying the medical articles of the Wikipedia Medicine Portal, which have been previously manually labeled by the Wiki Project team. The results of our experiments confirm that, by considering domain-oriented features, it is possible to obtain sensible improvements with respect to existing solutions, mainly for those articles that other approaches have less correctly classified. Other than being interesting by their own, the results call for further research in the area of domain specific features suitable for Web data quality assessment.},

This article approaches such a comparison through academic references made within the worlds 50 largest Wikipedias. Previous studies have raised concerns that Wikipedia editors may simply use the most easily accessible academic sources rather than sources of the highest academic status. We test this claim by identifying the 250 most heavily used journals in each of 26 research fields (4,721 journals, 19.4M articles in total) indexed by the Scopus database, and modeling whether topic, academic status, and accessibility make articles from these journals more or less likely to be referenced on Wikipedia. We find that, controlling for field and impact factor, the odds that an open access journal is referenced on the English Wikipedia are 47\% higher compared to closed access journals. Moreover, in most of the worlds Wikipedias a journals high status (impact factor) and accessibility (open access policy) both greatly increase the probability of referencing. Among the implications of this study is that the chief effect of open access policies may be to significantly amplify the diffusion of science, through an intermediary like Wikipedia, to a broad public audience.},

Edit wars can last from a few days to several years before reaching consensus often leading to a loss of content quality. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to create an agent-based model of edit wars in order to study the influence of various factors involved in consensus formation. We model the behavior of agents using theories of group stability and reinforcement learning. We show that increasing the number of credible or trustworthy agents and agents with a neutral point of view decreases the time taken to reach consensus, whereas the duration is longest when agents with opposing views are in equal proportion. Our model can be used to study the behavior of members in online communities and to inform policies and guidelines for participation.},

Therefore, we investigate causes for the usage of such inter-language links by comparing the tweeted article and its counterpart in the tweet's language (if there is any) in terms of article quality. We find that the main cause for inter-language links is the non-existence of the article in the tweet's language. Furthermore, we observe that the quality of the tweeted articles is constantly higher in comparison to their counterparts, suggesting that users choose the article of higher quality even when tweeting in another language. Moreover, we find that English is the most dominant target for inter-language links.},

This paper argues for a conceptual reorientation towards sequences as a fundamental unit of analysis for understanding work routines in online knowledge collaboration. We outline a research agenda for researchers in computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) to understand the relationships, patterns, antecedents, and consequences of sequential behavior using methods already developed in fields like bio-informatics. Using a data set of 37,515 revisions from 16,616 unique editors to 96 Wikipedia articles as a case study, we analyze the prevalence and significance of different sequences of editing patterns. We illustrate the mixed method potential of sequence approaches by interpreting the frequent patterns as general classes of behavioral motifs. We conclude by discussing the methodological opportunities for using sequence analysis for expanding existing approaches to analyzing and theorizing about co-production routines in online knowledge collaboration.},

Therefore, we cannot capture the changes of text meaning automatically, so we cannot detect whether the meaning of text survives or not. To solve this problem, we use crowdsourcing to manually detect changes of text meaning. In our experiment, we confirmed that our proposed method improves the accuracy of detecting vandals by about 5\%.},

  title    = {Assessment of {Online} {Patient} {Materials} for {Breast} {Reconstruction}},
  journal  = {Journal of Surgical Research},
  abstract = {AbstractBackground
Limited health literacy affects nearly half of American adults and adversely affects patient participation, satisfaction, healthcare costs, and overall outcomes. As patients increasingly search the internet for health information, accessibility of online material is critical. Previous studies examining this topic have focused on the readability of these materials. This study evaluates online breast reconstruction resources with regard to reading level, however, adds new metrics to assess degree of complexity, and suitability for the intended audience.
Methods
The ten most popular patient websites for "breast reconstruction" were identified using the largest internet search engine. The content of each site was assessed for readability using the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) analysis, complexity using the PMOSE/iKIRSCH formula, and suitability using the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) instrument. Resulting scores were analyzed overall and by website.
Results
Readability analysis revealed an overall average grade level of 13.4 (range 10.7-15.8). All sites exceeded the recommended 6th grade level. Complexity evaluation revealed a mean PMOSE/iKIRSCH score of 6.3, consistent with "low" complexity and requiring an 8th-12th grade education; individual sites ranged from "very low" to "high" complexity. Suitability assessment overall produced a mean 41.2\% score, interpreted as "adequate" for the intended patient audience. Five of the ten sites were found to be "not suitable" when examined individually; the remaining five were "adequate".
Conclusions
Available online patient material for breast reconstruction is often too difficult for many patients to understand based on readability, complexity, and suitability metrics. Comprehensive assessment is needed to design appropriate patient material and minimize disparities related to limited health literacy.},

Finally, we use a combination of featured article information and the weighted models to obtain the best performance.

The text is first pre-processed to tokenize the sentences and perform stemming operations. We then score the sentences using the different text features. Two novel approaches implemented are using the citations present in the text and identifying synonyms. These features along with the traditional methods are used to score the sentences. The scores are used to classify the sentence to be in the summary text or not with the help of a neural network. The user can provide what percentage of the original text should be in the summary.

The "Beyond the Book" project investigates whether web resources like Wikipedia can be used to establish the level of cultural bias. This work describes the eScience tools used to estimate the cultural appeal of a book: semantic linking is used to identify key words in the text of the book, and afterwards the revision information from corresponding Wikipedia articles is examined to identify countries that generated a more than average amount of contributions to those articles. Comparison between the number of contributions from two countries on the same set of articles may show with which knowledge the contributors are familiar. We assume a lack of contributions from a country may indicate a gap in the knowledge of readers from that country. We assume that a book dealing with that concept could be more exotic and therefore more appealing for certain readers, while others are therefore less interested in the book. An indication of the 'level of exoticness' thus could help a reader/publisher to decide to read/translate the book or not. Experimental results are presented for four selected books from a set of 564 books written in Dutch or translated into Dutch, assessing their potential appeal for a Canadian audience. A qualitative assessment of quantitative results provides insight into named entities that may indicate a high/low cultural bias towards a book.},

Bespoke code complicates the common metaphors of platforms and sovereignty that we typically use to discuss the governance and regulation of software systems through code. Specifically, the work of automated software agents (bots) in the operation and administration of Wikipedia is examined, with a focus on the materiality of code. As bots extend and modify the functionality of sites like Wikipedia, but must be continuously operated on computers that are independent from the servers hosting the site, they involve alternative relations of power and code. Instead of taking for granted the pre-existing stability of Wikipedia as a platform, bots and other bespoke code require that we examine not only the software code itself, but also the concrete, historically contingent material conditions under which this code is run. To this end, this article weaves a series of autobiographical vignettes about the author's experiences as a bot developer alongside more traditional academic discourse.},

Wikidata is a likewise global crowdsourced knowledge base that provides shared facts to be used by Wikipedias. In the context of this research, we have developed an application and an underlying Application Programming Interface (API) capable of monitoring realtime edit activity of all language versions of Wikipedia and Wikidata. This application allows us to easily analyze edits in order to answer questions such as "Bots vs. Wikipedians, who edits more?", "Which is the most anonymously edited Wikipedia?", or "Who are the bots and what do they edit?". To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such an analysis could be done in realtime for Wikidata and for really all Wikipedias--large and small. Our application is available publicly online at the URL http://wikipedia-edits.herokuapp.com/, its code has been open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license.},

  abstract   = {Before User Generated Content (UGC) became widespread, the majority of web content was generated for a specific target audience and in the language of that target audience. When information was to be published in multiple languages, it was done using well-established localisation methods. With the growth in UGC there are a number of issues, which seem incompatible with the traditional model of software localisation. First and foremost, the number of content contributors has increased hugely. As a by-product of this development, we are also witnessing a large expansion in the scale and variety of the content. Consequently, the demand for traditional forms of localisation (based on existing language resources, a professional pool of translators, and localisation experts) has become unsustainable. Additionally, the requirements and nature of the type of translation are shifting as well: The more web-based communities multiply in scale, type and geographical distribution, the more varied and global their requirements are. However, the growth in UGC also presents a number of localisation opportunities. In this chapter, we investigate web-enabled collaborative construction of language resources (translation memories) using micro-crowdsourcing approaches, as a means of addressing the diversity and scale issues that arise in UGC contexts and in software systems generally. As the proposed approaches are based on the expertise of human translators, they also address many of the quality issues related to MT-based solutions. The first example we provide describes a client-server architecture (UpLoD) where individual users translate elements of an application and its documentation as they use them, in return for free access to these applications. Periodically, the elements of the system and documentation translated by the individual translators are gathered centrally and are aggregated into an integral translation of all, or parts of, the system that can then be re-distributed to the system’s users. This architecture is shown to feed into the design of a browser extension-based client-server architecture (BE-COLA) that allows for the capturing and aligning of source and target content produced by the ‘power of the crowd’. The architectural approach chosen enables collaborative, in-context, and real-time localisation of web content supported by the crowd and generation of high-quality language resources.},

It comprises three main steps, namely, mention recognition, candidate generation, and entity linking. For candidate generation, existing methods use hyperlinks in Wikipedia or match a mention of discourse to Wikipedia article titles. They may miss the correct target entity and thus fail to link the mention to Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose to use a mention as a query and Wikipedia own search engine to look for additional candidate articles. Moreover, for entity linking, we introduce new coreference heuristics and apply the incremental liking approach. The conducted experiments show that our proposed method outperforms or achieves competitive results in comparison to some state-of-the-art systems, but is simpler and uses less features.},

  abstract   = {The last 20 years of advancement in sequencing technologies have led to sequencing thousands of microbial genomes, creating mountains of genetic data. While efficiency in generating the data improves almost daily, applying meaningful relationships between taxonomic and genetic entities on this scale requires a structured and integrative approach. Currently, knowledge is distributed across a fragmented landscape of resources from government-funded institutions such as National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and UniProt to topic-focused databases like the ODB3 database of prokaryotic operons, to the supplemental table of a primary publication. A major drawback to large scale, expert-curated databases is the expense of maintaining and extending them over time. No entity apart from a major institution with stable long-term funding can consider this, and their scope is limited considering the magnitude of microbial data being generated daily. Wikidata is an openly editable, semantic web compatible framework for knowledge representation. It is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation and offers knowledge integration capabilities ideally suited to the challenge of representing the exploding body of information about microbial genomics. We are developing a microbial specific data model, based on Wikidata’s semantic web compatibility, which represents bacterial species, strains and the gene and gene products that define them. Currently, we have loaded 43 694 gene and 37 966 protein items for 21 species of bacteria, including the human pathogenic bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. Using this pathogen as an example, we explore complex interactions between the pathogen, its host, associated genes, other microbes, disease and drugs using the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint. In our next phase of development, we will add another 99 bacterial genomes and their gene and gene products, totaling ∼900,000 additional entities. This aggregation of knowledge will be a platform for community-driven collaboration, allowing the networking of microbial genetic data through the sharing of knowledge by both the data and domain expert.},

Increasingly, access takes place in social networked markets characterized by communities of users that serve to select and rank content to facilitate reuse. Publication of heritage in such digital medium transforms patterns of consumption. We performed a quantitative analysis on the access to a museum collection and compared results before and after publication on Wikimedia. Analysis of the difference in access showed two main results: first, access to collections increased substantially online. From a selection of the most viewed objects, access grew from an average of 156,000 onsite visitors per year (or 15.5 million in a century) to over 1.5 million views online per year (or 7.9 million in five years). Second, we find a long tail in both mediums, where 8\% of objects were exhibited onsite and 11\% of available objects online were used in Wikipedia articles (representing 1\% of the total collection). We further document differences in consumer preference for type of object, favouring 3D onsite and 2D online, as well as topic and language preference, favouring Wikipedia articles about geography and in English. Online publication is hence an important complement to onsite exhibitions to increase access to collections. Results shed light on online consumption of heritage content by consumers who may not necessarily visit heritage sites.},

The study explores how traffic to Wikipedia articles on topics that raise privacy concerns for Wikipedia users decreased after the widespread publicity about NSA/PRISM surveillance revelations in June 2013. Using an interdisciplinary research design, the study tests the hypothesis, based on chilling effects theory, that traffic to privacy-sensitive Wikipedia articles reduced after the mass surveillance revelations. The Article finds not only a statistically significant immediate decline in traffic for these Wikipedia articles after June 2013, but also a change in the overall secular trend in the view count traffic, suggesting not only immediate but also long-term chilling effects resulting from the NSA/PRISM online surveillance revelations. These, and other results from the case study, not only offer compelling evidence for chilling effects associated with online surveillance, but also offer important insights about how we should understand such chilling effects and their scope, including how they interact with other dramatic or significant events (like war and conflict) and their broader implications for privacy, U.S. constitutional litigation, and the health of democratic society. This study is among the first to demonstrate— using either Wikipedia data or web traffic data more generally— how government surveillance and similar actions impact online activities, including access to information and knowledge online},

In addition, we also show the periodic nature of the number of inter-event in time. The results of our work shed some light on the activity scheduling present in our society, contributing to the circadian patterns understanding.},

Taking Wikipedia as a test case, we use a hidden Markov model to approximate the computational structure and social grammar of more than a decade of cooperation and conflict among its editors. Across a wide range of pages, we discover a bursty war/peace structure where the systems can become trapped, sometimes for months, in a computational subspace associated with significantly higher levels of conflict-tracking “revert” actions. Distinct patterns of behavior characterize the lower-conflict subspace, including tit-for-tat reversion. While a fraction of the transitions between these subspaces are associated with top-down actions taken by administrators, the effects are weak. Surprisingly, we find no statistical signal that transitions are associated with the appearance of particularly anti-social users, and only weak association with significant news events outside the system. These findings are consistent with transitions being driven by decentralized processes with no clear locus of control. Models of belief revision in the presence of a common resource for information-sharing predict the existence of two distinct phases: a disordered high-conflict phase, and a frozen phase with spontaneously-broken symmetry. The bistability we observe empirically may be a consequence of editor turn-over, which drives the system to a critical point between them.},

Within Wikipedia, the surprising answer is yes: nearly all paths lead to Philosophy. Wikipedia is the largest, most meticulously indexed collection of human knowledge ever amassed. More than information about a topic, Wikipedia is a web of naturally emerging relationships. By following the first link in each article, we algorithmically construct a directed network of all 4.7 million articles: Wikipedia's First Link Network. Here, we study the English edition of Wikipedia's First Link Network for insight into how the many articles on inventions, places, people, objects, and events are related and organized. By traversing every path, we measure the accumulation of first links, path lengths, groups of path-connected articles, cycles, and the influence each article exerts in shaping the network. We find scale-free distributions describe path length, accumulation, and influence. Far from dispersed, first links disproportionately accumulate at a few articles--flowing from specific to general and culminating around fundamental notions such as Community, State, and Science. Philosophy directs more paths than any other article by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a gravitation towards topical articles such as Health Care and Fossil Fuel. These findings enrich our view of the connections and structure of Wikipedia's ever growing store of knowledge.},

Little is known about how this potential for controversy affects the accuracy and stability of information on scientific topics, especially those with associated political controversy. Here we present an analysis of the Wikipedia edit histories for seven scientific articles and show that topics we consider politically but not scientifically “controversial” (such as evolution and global warming) experience more frequent edits with more words changed per day than pages we consider “noncontroversial” (such as the standard model in physics or heliocentrism). For example, over the period we analyzed, the global warming page was edited on average (geometric mean ±SD) 1.9±2.7 times resulting in 110.9±10.3 words changed per day, while the standard model in physics was only edited 0.2±1.4 times resulting in 9.4±5.0 words changed per day. The high rate of change observed in these pages makes it difficult for experts to monitor accuracy and contribute time-consuming corrections, to the possible detriment of scientific accuracy. As our society turns to Wikipedia as a primary source of scientific information, it is vital we read it critically and with the understanding that the content is dynamic and vulnerable to vandalism and other shenanigans.},

  abstract  = {The malicious modification of articles, termed vandalism, is a serious problem for open access encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. Wikipedia’s counter-vandalism bots and past vandalism detection research have greatly reduced the exposure and damage of common and obvious types of vandalism. However, there remains increasingly more sneaky types of vandalism that are clearly out of context of the sentence or article. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware and cross-language vandalism detection technique that scales to the size of the full Wikipedia and extends the types of vandalism detectable beyond past feature-based approaches. Our technique uses word dependencies to identify vandal words in sentences by combining part-of-speech tagging with a conditional random fields classifier. We evaluate our technique on two Wikipedia data sets: the PAN data sets with over 62,000 edits, commonly used by related research; and our own vandalism repairs data sets with over 500 million edits of over 9 million articles from five languages. As a comparison, we implement a feature-based classifier to analyse the quality of each classification technique and the trade-offs of each type of classifier. Our results show how context-aware detection techniques can become a new counter-vandalism tool for Wikipedia that complements current feature-based techniques.},

  abstract   = {Scientific controversy is increasingly played out via the internet, a technology that is simultaneously content, medium and research infrastructure. Here we analyse material from Wikipedia, focusing on schizophrenia genetics. We find that citation and curation of scientific resources follow a negotiated, ad hoc adherence to Wikipedia rules, are based on limited access to scientific literature, and thus lead to a partially constructed ‘review’ of the science that excludes non-professionals. Given its policies and systems for developing neutral, evidence-based articles, one would not expect to find controversy on Wikipedia, yet we find traces. Scientific ambiguity about schizophrenia genetics lends itself to multiple ways of curating resources, and the infrastructure of online spaces enables the practices behind curation work to become visible in new ways. We argue that not only does Wikipedia make scientific controversy visible to a wider range of people, it is also involved in the production of knowledge.},

  abstract   = {The impressive success of peer production – a large-scale collaborative model of production primarily based on voluntary contributions – is difficult to explain by relying solely on standard assumptions about individual preferences. This paper studies the prosocial foundations of cooperation in Wikipedia, a peer production economy in which monetary incentives play no role in shaping individual behavior. We design an online experiment coupled with observational data to elicit social motives within a representative sample of 850 Wikipedia contributors, and use those measures to predict subjects’ field contributions to the Wikipedia project. We thus provide the first comprehensive field test of existing economic theories of prosocial motives for contributing to real-world public goods. We find that regular editors’ field contributions to Wikipedia are strongly related to their level of reciprocity in a conditional Public Goods game and in a Trust game and to their revealed preference for social image within the Wikipedia community, but not to their level of altruism either in a standard or in a directed Dictator game. The extent of participation within the group of Wikipedia administrators – who self-selected into performing a policing role within the Wikipedia community – is positively related to their revealed preference for social image but, unlike regular contributors, strongly  negatively  related to their level of reciprocity. Using our measure of trust in strangers from the Trust game, we show that while trust is unrelated to contribution levels among regular editors, less trusting Wikipedia administrators are significantly more active and more likely to exercise their policing rights.},

When a distributed group works together in such a setting, the mechanisms they use for coordination can play an important role in the effectiveness of the group's performance. Here we consider the trade-offs inherent in coordination in these on-line settings, balancing the benefits to collaboration with the cost in effort that could be spent in other ways. We consider two diverse domains that each contain a wide range of collaborations taking place simultaneously -- Wikipedia and GitHub -- allowing us to study how coordination varies across different projects. We analyze trade-offs in coordination along two main dimensions, finding similar effects in both our domains of study: first we show that, in aggregate, high-status projects on these sites manage the coordination trade-off at a different level than typical projects; and second, we show that projects use a different balance of coordination when they are "crowded," with relatively small size but many participants. We also develop a stylized theoretical model for the cost-benefit trade-off inherent in coordination and show that it qualitatively matches the trade-offs we observe between crowdedness and coordination.},

  abstract   = {Narrative theorists have long recognised that narrative is a selective mode of representation. There is always more than one way to tell a story, which may alter according to its teller, audience and the social or historical context in which the story is told. But multiple versions of the ‘same’ events are not always valued in the same way: some versions may become established as dominant accounts, whilst others may be marginalised or resist hegemony as counter narratives (Bamberg and Andrews, 2004). This essay explores the potential of Wikipedia as a site for positioning counter and dominant narratives. Through the analysis of linearity and tellership (Ochs and Capps, 2001) as exemplified through revisions of a particular article (‘Murder of Meredith Kercher’), I show how structural choices (open versus closed sequences) and tellership (single versus multiple narrators) function as mechanisms to prioritise different dominant narratives over time and across different cultural contexts. The case study points to the dynamic and relative nature of dominant and counter narratives. In the ‘Murder of Meredith Kercher’ article the counter narratives of the suspects’ guilt or innocence and their position as villains or victims depended on national context, and changed over time. The changes in the macro-social narratives are charted in the micro-linguistic analysis of structure, citations and quoted speech in four selected versions of the article, taken from the English and Italian Wikipedias.},

To observe critical thinking skills in wiki collaborations under different levels of instructional guidance, two graduate wikibook projects were selected: an enhanced scaffolding case (ESC) which involved structured wikibook guidelines and critical feedback exercises, and a minimal scaffolding case (MSC) which involved only basic wikibook guidelines. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis methods were adopted to compare students’ perceived and observed levels of critical thinking and participation in wikibook creation. Results showed that participants in the ESC displayed relatively higher critical thinking levels as wikibook authors and peer editors. Participants in the MSC displayed relatively lower critical thinking levels, but showed more active participation in terms of the frequencies of words edited in wikibook chapters. As peer editors, however, students in both cases tended to show low levels of critical thinking and participate passively even though they considered wikibooks to be a useful online collaboration tool. Document and interview analyses revealed that MSC students experienced difficulties developing their wikibooks due to the lack of instructional assistance and displayed more trial and error, which led to their low critical thinking levels and high participation levels. One student with expertise in wikis dominated peer editing in the MSC group, but the ESC group had relatively even contributions among peers in critical thinking and participation because enhanced scaffolding was more effective for those who did not have prior knowledge and experience in wikis or editing.},

The use of counter-vandalism bots is changing the way Wikipedia identifies and bans vandals, but their contributions are often not considered nor discussed. In this paper, we propose novel text features capturing the invariants of vandalism across five languages to learn and compare the contributions of bots and users in the task of identifying vandalism. We construct computationally efficient features that highlight the contributions of bots and users, and generalize across languages.We evaluate our proposed features through classification performance on revisions of five Wikipedia languages, totaling over 500 million revisions of over 9 million articles. As a comparison, we evaluate these features on the small PAN Wikipedia vandalism data sets, used by previous research, which contain approximately 62,000 revisions. We show differences in the performance of our features on the PAN and the full Wikipedia data set. With the appropriate text features, vandalism bots can be effective across different languages while learning from only one language. Our ultimate aim is to build the next generation of vandalism detection bots based on machine learning approaches that can work effectively across many languages.},

It observes the responses of people when “other” people enter a crowd where internal and external controls are mostly absent. From the analysis of 342 Wikipedia articles, this study shows that the overall tone of Wikipedia articles is mostly decided by a dominant few rather than by a trivial many, and such domination worsens as the number of participant increases and the article matures. This result contradicts a common belief on crowdsourcing that Wikipedia would reflect the voices of a vast majority, obtain a balanced solution, and attain democracy on the Internet. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature by analyzing how effectively Wikipedia functions as a crowdsourcing platform within the context. It also implies that developing a proper crowdsourcing strategy such as effective management of a platform is necessary, especially when an organization has a specific goal to achieve throughout a project.},

The magnitude of the effect is large; content growth over an eight-year period would have been 45\% lower in its absence. Our findings suggest that other open content production environments are likely to also benefit from similar cumulative growth effects.

Wikipedia's public hourly pageview data provides a unique opportunity to study the influence of a Reddit post on a Wikipedia page at different time horizons. We here present analyses using posts from 2012 in TIL, showing that the week in which a post references a specific Wikipedia article is associated with a substantial increase in pageviews relative to prior and successive weeks. We then apply functional PC A to the dataset in order to characterize pageview dynamics. We also provide a qualitative analysis of the subset of Wikipedia topics posted to Reddit.},

They both face similar challenges over the length, tone, and factual basis of controversial, unverifiable, and subjective content. Such challenges are pervasive in the production of encyclopedic knowledge about current events and political debates surrounding topics like taxation, health care policies, biographical details of presidential candidates, and the funding of stem-cell research, for example. In this paper the authors begin with a simple observation: Each source resolves these challenges differently in distinct production processes. Britannica, for example, produces its final content after consultation between editors and experts. Wikipedia, on the other hand, relies on the crowd for its content, receiving contributions from tens of millions of individual users. Examining 3,918 pairs of articles about US politics that appeared in both outlets, the authors compare bias and slant from the two production models. Results suggest that the allocation of editorial time and user contributions is central to the minimization of differences in bias and slant between the two outlets. Among the managerial implications, community managers can work towards a balanced view if intervention alleviates disputes and generates the right kind of participation.},

This introduces the need for concrete evaluation of Wikipedia as a foundation for computing semantic relatedness between concepts.

Furthermore, semantic relatedness methods that rely on the hierarchical structure of a lexical resource are not directly applicable to the Wikipedia link structure, which is not hierarchical and whose links do not capture well defined semantic relationships like hyponymy. In this paper we (1) Evaluate Wikipedia in a domain specific semantic relatedness task and demonstrate that Wikipedia based methods can be competitive with state of the art ontology based methods and distributional methods in the biomedical domain (2) Adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of bibliometric methods of various degrees of sophistication on Wikipedia (3) Propose a new graph-based method for calculating semantic relatedness that outperforms existing methods by considering some specific features of Wikipedia structure.},

  abstract   = {Disagreement and conflict are a fact of social life and considerably affect our well-being and productivity. Such negative interactions are rarely explicitly declared and recorded and this makes them hard for scientists to study. We overcome this challenge by investigating the patterns in the timing and configuration of contributions to a large online collaboration community. We analyze sequences of reverts of contributions to Wikipedia, the largest online encyclopedia, and investigate how often and how fast they occur compared to a null model that randomizes the order of actions to remove any systematic clustering. We find evidence that individuals systematically attack the same person and attack back their attacker; both of these interactions occur at a faster response rate than expected. We also establish that individuals come to defend an attack victim but we do not find evidence that attack victims "pay it forward" or that attackers collude to attack the same individual. We further find that high-status contributors are more likely to attack many others serially, status equals are more likely to revenge attacks back, while attacks by lower-status contributors trigger attacks forward; yet, it is the lower-status contributors who also come forward to defend third parties. The method we use can be applied to other large-scale temporal communication and collaboration networks to identify the existence of negative social interactions and other social processes.},

As a source of exogenous variation in the economic state we use the fact that European countries were affected by the financial crisis in the US in September 2008 with different intensity. For European countries, we find that the economic downturn is associated with more viewership, which channels higher participation of volunteers in Wikipedia expressed in editing activity and content growth. We provide evidence for increased information search online or online learning as a potential channel of the change in public goods provision, which is a potentially important side effect of economic downturn.},

Internet systems are particularly attractive for disease outbreaks because they can provide data in near real-time and can be verified by individuals around the globe. However, most existing systems have focused on disease monitoring and do not provide a data repository for policy makers or researchers. In order to fill this gap, we analyzed Wikipedia article content. We demonstrate how a named-entity recognizer can be trained to tag case counts, death counts, and hospitalization counts in the article narrative that achieves an F1 score of 0.753. We also show, using the the 2014 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic article as a case study, that there are detailed time series data that are consistently updated that closely align with ground truth data. We argue that Wikipedia can be used to create the first community-driven open-source emerging disease detection, monitoring, and repository system.},

  abstract   = {Background Despite the undisputed role of emotions in teamwork, not much is known about the make-up of emotions in online collaboration. Publicly available repositories of collaboration data, such as Wikipedia editor discussions, now enable the large-scale study of affect and dialogue in peer production. Methods We investigate the established Wikipedia community and focus on how emotion and dialogue differ depending on the status, gender, and the communication network of the editors who have written at least 100 comments on the English Wikipedia's article talk pages. Emotions are quantified using a word-based approach comparing the results of two predefined lexicon-based methods: LIWC and SentiStrength. Principal Findings We find that administrators maintain a rather neutral, impersonal tone, while regular editors are more emotional and relationship-oriented, that is, they use language to form and maintain connections to other editors. A persistent gender difference is that female contributors communicate in a manner that promotes social affiliation and emotional connection more than male editors, irrespective of their status in the community. Female regular editors are the most relationship-oriented, whereas male administrators are the least relationship-focused. Finally, emotional and linguistic homophily is prevalent: editors tend to interact with other editors having similar emotional styles (e.g., editors expressing more anger connect more with one another). Conclusions/Significance Emotional expression and linguistic style in online collaboration differ substantially depending on the contributors' gender and status, and on the communication network. This should be taken into account when analyzing collaborative success, and may prove insightful to communities facing gender gap and stagnation in contributor acquisition and participation levels.},

Unwarranted stigma is attached to the use of Wikipedia in higher education due to fears that students will not pursue rigorous research practices because of the easy access to information that Wikipedia facilitates. In studies referred to in this paper, undergraduate writing students are taught about the need to interrogate any information they find on Wikipedia just as they would other online source material. They are inducted into fact checking, editing and creating Wikipedia articles as a means to analyse source material critically and to advance their research, writing and digital literacy. Meanwhile, in a postgraduate course in magazine studies, instead of writing essays, students are promoting Australian magazines and print culture by writing Wikipedia entries about Antipodean magazines and their editors. These courses experiment with new approaches to formative and summative assessment; promote group research, collaborative and participatory writing, writing across networks and negotiating discourse communities; and challenge students’ perceptions about peer review and the legitimacy of Wikipedia.},

This project is on importing the full English Wikipedia into an Apache Hadoop cluster and indexing it by Apache Solr, so that it can be searched. 
 
A prototype was designed and implemented. A small subset of the Wikipedia data was unpacked and imported into Apache Hadoop’s HDFS. The entire Wikipedia Dataset was also downloaded onto a Hadoop Cluster at Virginia Tech. A portion of the dataset was converted from XML to Avro and imported into HDFS on the cluster. 
 
Future work would be to finish unpacking the full dataset and repeat the steps carried out with the prototype system, for all of WIkipedia. Unpacking the remaining data, converting it to Avro, and importing it into HDFS can be done with minimal adjustments to the script written for this job. Continuously run, this job would take an estimated 30 hours to complete.},

New collaborative platforms are forming which are providing individuals with new communities and knowledge bases and, at the same time, offering insights into human activity for researchers, policy-makers and engineers. On a global scale, the role of cultural and language barriers when studying such phenomena becomes particularly relevant and presents significant challenges: due to insufficient information, it is often hard to establish the cultural or language groups in which individuals belong, while there are technical difficulties in establishing the relevance and in analysing resources in different languages. This paper presents a framework to the end of addressing those issues by leveraging data on the use of Wikipedia. Resources available in different languages are explicitly correlated in Wikipedia along with time-stamped logs of access to its articles. This paper provides a framework to enable temporal page views in Wikipedia to be associated with specific geographic profiles. This framework is then used to examine the exchange of information between the English speaking and Chinese speaking localities and reports initial findings on the role of language and culture in diffusion in this context.},

However, the navigational data used in the corresponding works are sparse and expected to be biased since they have been collected in the context of games. In this paper, we raise this limitation and explore if semantic relatedness can also be extracted from unconstrained navigation. To this end, we first highlight structural differences between unconstrained navigation and game data. Then, we adapt a state of the art approach to extract semantic relatedness on Wikipedia paths. We apply this approach to transitions derived from two unconstrained navigation datasets as well as transitions from WikiGame and compare the results based on two common gold standards. We confirm expected structural differences when comparing unconstrained navigation with the paths collected by WikiGame. In line with this result, the mentioned state of the art approach for semantic extraction on navigation data does not yield good results for unconstrained navigation. Yet, we are able to derive a relatedness measure that performs well on both unconstrained navigation data as well as game data. Overall, we show that unconstrained navigation data on Wikipedia is suited for extracting semantics.},

Our research objective is to understand what the main factors are that influence the teaching uses of Wikipedia among university faculty. Based on a Technology Acceptance Model, and using data from an online survey sent to all faculty members of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, we analyze the relationships within the internal and external constructs of the model. 
 
We found that both the perception of colleagues¿ opinion about Wikipedia and the perceived quality of the information in Wikipedia play a central role in our model. These two constructs have a significant direct impact on the perceived usefulness of Wikipedia. This perceived usefulness affects, mediated by the behavioral intention of using Wikipedia, the effective use behavior of the encyclopedia. The degree to which an individual considers it is important to participate in open collaborative environments and the 2.0 profile of the faculty members also play an important role in our model.},

This research investigates the various ways in which these communities manage this issue. It is shown that communities of open-source software—continue to—rely mainly on hierarchy (reserving write-access for higher echelons), which substitutes (the need for) trust. Encyclopedic communities, though, largely avoid this solution. In the particular case of Wikipedia, which is confronted with persistent vandalism, another arrangement has been pioneered instead. Trust (i.e. full write-access) is ‘backgrounded’ by means of a permanent mobilization of Wikipedians to monitor incoming edits. Computational approaches have been developed for the purpose, yielding both sophisticated monitoring tools that are used by human patrollers, and bots that operate autonomously. Measures of reputation are also under investigation within Wikipedia; their incorporation in monitoring efforts, as an indicator of the trustworthiness of editors, is envisaged. These collective monitoring efforts are interpreted as focusing on avoiding possible damage being inflicted on Wikipedian spaces, thereby being allowed to keep the discretionary powers of editing intact for all users.

Finally it is argued that the Wikipedian monitoring of new edits, especially by its heavy reliance on computational tools, raises a number of moral questions that need to be answered urgently.},

  abstract = {AbstractIntroduction
It is suspected that Web 2.0 web sites, with a lot of user-generated content, often support viewpoints that link autism to vaccines.
Methods
We assessed the prevalence of the views supporting a link between vaccines and autism online by comparing YouTube, Google and Wikipedia with PubMed. Freedom of speech is highest on YouTube and progressively decreases for the others.
Results
Support for a link between vaccines and autism is most prominent on YouTube, followed by Google search results. It is far lower on Wikipedia and PubMed. Anti-vaccine activists use scientific arguments, certified physicians and official-sounding titles to gain credibility, while also leaning on celebrity endorsement and personalized stories.
Conclusions
Online communities with greater freedom of speech lead to a dominance of anti-vaccine voices. Moderation of content by editors can offer balance between free expression and factual accuracy. Health communicators and medical institutions need to step up their activity on the Internet.},

Our main contribution is an end-to-end system for recommending
articles for creation that exist in one language but are missing in another.
The system involves identifying missing articles, ranking the
missing articles according to their importance, and recommending
important missing articles to editors based on their interests. We
empirically validate our models in a controlled experiment involving
12,000 French Wikipedia editors. We find that personalizing
recommendations increases editor engagement by a factor of two.
Moreover, recommending articles increases their chance of being
created by a factor of 3.2. Finally, articles created as a result of our
recommendations are of comparable quality to organically created
articles. Overall, our system leads to more engaged editors and
faster growth of Wikipedia with no effect on its quality.},

  abstract    = {The principles of trademark law were not developed with collaborative communities in mind. Trademark law expects centralized control and certain formalities in trademark use and licensing. These formalities are designed for traditional firms, which maintain central control over production. Collaborative communities, on the other hand, thrive on their lack of centralization. Prominent examples of projects developed by collaborative communities include Wikipedia, the Linux operating system, and Mozilla’s Firefox browser. These projects are largely enabled by the Internet, which allows decentralized collaborators around the world to participate in the development of code and content. They are also facilitated by open source and free culture copyright licenses, which allow members of these communities to reuse and improve upon work of other members. For that and other reasons, the members tend to be ideologically opposed to traditional intellectual property rights. At the same time, they are able to produce popular software and knowledge projects, distributed in commerce, and identified with famous brands. Members of these communities expect that their work can be protected from abuse, and users expect that they can rely on these brands to identify high-quality products. Trademark law can provide these protections to both the communities and the users of their products, but it imposes certain limitations on how community members can use logos that are inconsistent with the practices of most collaborative communities. This Article outlines the Catch-22 problem faced by lawyers working on protecting collaboratively developed projects. It uses Yochai Benkler’s model for commons-based peer production to introduce collaborative communities, their governance and structure, and their values. It further explains why collaborative communities face challenges, particularly under the doctrine of naked licensing. The Article also introduces a descriptive taxonomy of “hacks” that collaborative communities have attempted to use to mitigate the tensions between trademark law and their values. The taxonomy explains these hacks as answers to a set of questions: 1. Who holds the community’s trademark? 2. What type of trademark does the community hold? 3. What are the trademark restrictions? 4. How does the community design their trademark restrictions?},

  abstract    = {Many online communities consist of subgroups that co-exist on the same technical platform and serve
different interests or purposes. Yet we have limited knowledge of the interplay between subgroups and
the large community as a whole and the trade-offs between various outcomes. Does greater contribution
at the subgroup level lead to greater or lower contribution to the large community? Are members who
belong to multiple subgroups more socially embedded and therefore less likely to leave? Are active
contributors more or less likely to leave the community? In this paper, we analyze data from 648
WikiProjects and the archived behaviors of 14,464 member editors to address these questions. Our results
reveal two critical trade-offs in managing online production communities. First, a number of factors that
increase member contribution such as tenure dissimilarity and past contribution also increase one’s
likelihood of leaving the community, perhaps due to conflict or feelings of “mission accomplished” or
“burnout”. Second, individual membership in multiple projects has mixed and largely negative effects. It
decreases the amount of work editors contribute to both the individual projects and Wikipedia as a whole.
It reduces one’s likelihood of leaving individual project yet increases the likelihood of leaving Wikipedia
as a whole. The study advances our understanding about the trade-offs between multiple community
outcomes and the interplay between subgroups and the large community as a whole.},

Current evidence has shown that students may navigate by either performing a deep semantic analysis of the relationship between the question and the existing hyperlinks, or by matching words in the question to words in the hyperlink labels. We focused on how students combine both cues during navigation, and how comprehension skills relate to the use of such cues. Our study revealed that 14 year old students (N = 53) selected hyperlinks by relying to a similar degree on both word matching and semantic overlap. Furthermore, when there was a conflict between an irrelevant link cued via word matching and a relevant link only cued through semantic overlap, students’ comprehension skills facilitated their initial selection of an informative relevant link. To conclude, we discuss the implications of these results for current models of hypertext navigation.},

To study how the organization of Wikipedia articles in terms of layout and links affects navigation behavior, we first investigate the characteristics of the structural organization and of hyperlinks in Wikipedia and then evaluate link selection models based on article structure and other potential influences in navigation, such as the generality of an article's topic. In free-form Wikipedia navigation, covering all Wikipedia usage scenarios, we find that click choices can be best modeled by a bias towards article structure, such as a tendency to click links located in the lead section. For the goal-directed navigation of wikigames, our findings confirm the zoom-out and the homing-in phases identified by previous work, where users are guided by generality at first and textual similarity to the target later. However, our interpretation of the link selection models accentuates that article structure is the best explanation for the navigation paths in all except these initial and final stages. Overall, we find evidence that users more frequently click on links that are located close to the top of an article. The structure of Wikipedia articles, which places links to more general concepts near the top, supports navigation by allowing users to quickly find the better-connected articles that facilitate navigation. Our results highlight the importance of article structure and link position in Wikipedia navigation and suggest that better organization of information can help make information networks more navigable.},

In the second phase, seasonal feature vectors are generated for each spot by referring to the distribution of keywords contained in tweets associated with spots for each season.

“social desirability,” “concern for others’ well-being,” “cognitive group membership,” 
“avoidance of negative self-affect,” “need to be entertained,” “seeking of creative 
stimulation,” and “providing information.” Additional analysis revealed that “providing 
information,” “seeking of creative stimulation” and “concern for others’ well-being” were the three strongest motivations while “seeking of creative stimulation,” “need to be 
entertained,” and “providing information” were the three significantly correlated 
motivations with one’s satisfaction gained from editing Wikipedia.},

As the public increasingly turns to online resources for health information, this study analyzed the development of the referencing as the basis for Wikipedia content on nutritional health topics over five years. The study found that Wikipedia articles on nine selected nutrition topics do not only consistently rank among the top search results in major search engines, but have also been heavily edited and revised over time. A longitudinal content analysis of more than 3,000 references showed that the articles are greatly relying on academic publications as the sources for their information on nutrition, stressing the improved reliability of Wikipedia content.},

Current Web search engine technologies consider static collections and do not factor in explicitly or implicitly available temporal information, that can be leveraged to gain insights into the dynamics of the data. In this paper, we hypothesize that by employing the temporal aspect as the primary means for capturing the evolution of entities, it is possible to provide entity-based accessibility to Web archives. We empirically show that the edit activity on Wikipedia can be exploited to provide evidence of the evolution of Wikipedia pages over time, both in terms of their content and in terms of their temporally defined relationships, classified in literature as events. Finally, we present results from our extensive analysis of a dataset consisting of 31, 998 Wikipedia pages describing politicians, and observations from in-depth case studies. Our findings reflect the usefulness of leveraging temporal information in order to study the evolution of entities and breed promising grounds for further research.},

Wikipedia is a popular free online encyclopaedia used by patients and physicians to search for health-related information. Our aim was to evaluate information-seeking behaviour of English-speaking internet users searching Wikipedia for articles related to epilepsy and epileptic seizures. Using Wiki Trends, which provides quantitative information on daily viewing of articles, data on global search queries for Wikipedia articles related to epilepsy and seizures were analysed. The daily Wikipedia article views on syncope, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, migraine, and multiple sclerosis served as comparative data. The period of analysis covered was from January 2008 to December 2014. Overall, the Wikipedia article "epilepsy and driving" was found to be more frequently visited than the articles "epilepsy and employment" or "epilepsy in children". Since January 2008, the Wikipedia article "multiple sclerosis" was more often visited compared to the articles "epilepsy", "syncope", "psychogenic non-epileptic seizures" or "migraine"; the article "epilepsy" ranked 3,779 and was less frequently visited than "multiple sclerosis", ranked at 571, in traffic on Wikipedia. The highest peak in search volume for the article "epilepsy" coincided with the news of a celebrity having seizures. Fears and worries about epileptic seizures, their impact on driving and employment, and news about celebrities with epilepsy might be major determinants in searching Wikipedia for information.},

It started in 2001 with a single edition in the English language and has since expanded to more than 20 million articles in 283 languages. Criss-crossing between the Wikipedias is an inter-language link network, connecting the articles of one edition of Wikipedia to another. We describe characteristics of articles covered by nearly all Wikipedias and those covered by only a single language edition, we use the network to understand how we can judge the similarity between Wikipedias based on concept coverage, and we investigate the flow of translation between a selection of the larger Wikipedias. Our findings indicate that the relationships between Wikipedia editions follow Tobler's first law of geography: similarity decreases with increasing distance. The number of articles in a Wikipedia edition is found to be the strongest predictor of similarity, while language similarity also appears to have an influence. The English Wikipedia edition is by far the primary source of translations. We discuss the impact of these results for Wikipedia as well as user-generated content communities in general.},

To sustain healthy growth of the community, the Wikimedia Foundation aims to quantitatively understand the factors that determine the editing behavior, and explain why most new editors become inactive soon after joining. As a step towards this broader goal, the Wikimedia foundation sponsored the ICDM (IEEE International Conference for Data Mining) contest for the year 2011. The objective for the participants was to develop models to predict the number of edits that an editor will make in future five months based on the editing history of the editor. Here we describe the approach we followed for developing predictive models towards this goal, the results that we obtained and the modeling insights that we gained from this exercise. In addition, towards the broader goal of Wikimedia Foundation, we also summarize the factors that emerged during our model building exercise as powerful predictors of future editing activity.},

there sentiment differences in how Wikipedia
articles in different languages describe the
same war?”. This paper tackles this challenge
by proposing an automatic methodology
based on article level and concept level sentiment
analysis on multilingual Wikipedia articles.
The results obtained so far show that reasons
such as people’s feelings of involvement
and empathy can lead to sentiment expression
differences across multilingual Wikipedia on
war-related topics; the more people contribute
to an article on a war-related topic, the more
extreme sentiment the article will express; different
cultures also focus on different concepts
about the same war and present different sentiments
towards them. Moreover, our research
provides a framework for performing different
levels of sentiment analysis on multilingual
texts.},

However, the narrow diversity of the Wikipedia editor community has the potential to introduce systemic biases such as gender biases into the content of Wikipedia. In this paper we aim to tackle a sub problem of this larger challenge by presenting and applying a computational method for assessing gender bias on Wikipedia along multiple dimensions. We find that while women on Wikipedia are covered and featured well in many Wikipedia language editions, the way women are portrayed starkly differs from the way men are portrayed. We hope our work contributes to increasing awareness about gender biases online, and in particular to raising attention to the different levels in which gender biases can manifest themselves on the web.},

The experiments showed that for a similarity score higher than 0.7 all sentence pairs in the three language pairs were fully parallel.
However, including in the training sets less parallel sentence pairs (that is with a lower similarity score) showed significant
improvements in the translation quality (BLEU-based evaluations). The optimized SMT systems were evaluated on unseen test-sets
also extracted from Wikipedia. As one of the main goals of our work was to help Wikipedia contributors to translate (with as little post
editing as possible) new articles from major languages into less resourced languages and vice-versa, we call this type of translation
experiments “in-genre” translation. As in the case of “in-domain” translation, our evaluations showed that using only “in-genre”

Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, we reduce the number of queries by removing the less sensible ones and then select the best ones out of them.

Out of the hypotheses we explored, bilingualism, linguistic similarity of languages, and shared religion provide the best explanations for the similarity of interests between cultural communities. Population attraction and geographical proximity are also significant, but much weaker factors bringing communities together. In addition, we present an approach that allows for extracting significant cultural borders from editing activity of Wikipedia users, and comparing a set of hypotheses about the social mechanisms generating these borders. Our study sheds light on how culture is reflected in the collective process of archiving knowledge on Wikipedia, and demonstrates that cross-lingual interconnections on Wikipedia are not dominated by one powerful language. Our findings also raise some important policy questions for the Wikimedia Foundation.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we propose a novel task of automatically linking Wikipedia excerpts describing events to past news articles. Constantly evolving Wikipedia articles tend to summarize past events by abstracting fine-grained details that mattered when the event happened. On the other hand, contemporary news articles provide details of events, as they had happened. With connections between these two orthogonal information sources in place, a user could jump between them to acquire a holistic view on past events. We cast the linking problems into two retrieval tasks and propose a single framework for addressing them. In addition, we delineate challenges involved in both these tasks and propose a framework to address these challenges. To build a better understanding of the problem, we initially consider the simpler task of linking Wikipedia events that are systematically curated into years, decades and centuries, to relevant news articles from the past. These events come with a short textual description and a date indicating when the event happened. We present a two-stage cascade approach that leverages the temporal information associated to a given event for improving the linking effectiveness. We additionally design several baselines and show that our approach outperforms all the baselines. Through the results of studying the simplified task we come a step closer to solving the larger problem proposed in this paper. As future work, we plan to build an automatic linking system that answers to the challenges identified in this paper.},

  abstract   = {Besides finding trends and unveiling typical patterns, modern information retrieval is increasingly more interested in the discovery of surprising information in textual datasets. In this work we focus on finding "unexpected links" in hyperlinked document corpora when documents are assigned to categories. To achieve this goal, we model the hyperlinks graph through node categories: the presence of an arc is fostered or discouraged by the categories of the head and the tail of the arc. Specifically, we determine a latent category matrix that explains common links. The matrix is built using a margin-based online learning algorithm (Passive-Aggressive), which makes us able to process graphs with \$10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}\$ links in less than \$10\$ minutes. We show that our method provides better accuracy than most existing text-based techniques, with higher efficiency and relying on a much smaller amount of information. It also provides higher precision than standard link prediction, especially at low recall levels; the two methods are in fact shown to be orthogonal to each other and can therefore be fruitfully combined.},

We find that the preparation phase is equally important in expertbuilt and collaborative works and will fundamentally shape the final dictionary. For collaborative dictionaries, it is, however, essential to encourage discussion, define transparent decision workflows, and continually motivate the authors. The large user communities provide a high coverage of language varieties, translations, neologisms, as well as personal and spoken language, which often lack corpus evidence. Instead, their descriptions of general language terms are largely based on expert-built dictionaries. This is why we see great potential in the cooperation between expert lexicographers and collaborative user communities. Besides joint work on editing the dictionary articles, we consider quality assurance methods based on user feedback as a clear enrichment for dictionary making.},

Consistent with prior work, this research finds large differences in the representations of Okinawa in the content of the two editions. The number of users crossing the language boundary to edit both editions is also extremely small. When users do edit in a non-primary language, they most frequently edit articles that have cross-language (interwiki) links, articles that are edited more by other users, and articles that have more images. Finally, the possible value of edits from foreign-language users and design possibilities to motivate wider contributions from foreign-language users are discussed.},

Records of this process generate time series of events whose inter-event times follow a probability distribution that displays a fat tail. The grounds for such phenomenon are not yet clearly understood. In the present work we use the freely available Wikipedia's editing records to tackle this question by measuring the level of burstiness, as well as the memory effect of the editing tasks performed by different editors in different pages. Our main finding is that, even though the editing activity is conditioned by the circadian 24 hour cycle, the conditional probability of an activity of a given duration at a given time of the day is independent from the latter. This suggests that the human activity seems to be related to the high "cost" of starting an action as opposed to the much lower "cost" of continuing that action.},

While several prior studies have shown that the open-content production model can lead to high-quality output in the context of uncontroversial and verifiable information, it is unclear whether this production model will produce any desirable outcome when information is controversial, subjective, and unverifiable. We examine whether the open-content production model helps achieve a neutral point of view (NPOV) using data from Wikipedia's articles on U.S. politics. Our null hypothesis builds on Linus' Law, often expressed as "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." Our findings are consistent with a narrow interpretation of Linus' Law, namely, a greater number of contributors to an article makes an article more neutral. No evidence supports a broad interpretation of Linus' Law. Moreover, several empirical facts suggest the law does not shape many articles. The majority of articles receive little attention, and most articles change only mildly from their initial slant. Our study provides the first empirical evidence on the limit of Linus' Law. While many organizations believe that they could improve their knowledge production by leveraging communities, we show that in the case of Wikipedia, there are aspects, such as NPOV, that the community does not always achieve successfully.},

In this study, I investigated Wikipedia's personal communication network and analyzed which Wikipedia editors are utilizing it and how they are connected to outcome quality. Evidence suggests that people who utilize these networks are more experienced in editing high quality articles and are more integrated in the community. Additionally, these individuals utilize the personal communication network for coordinating and perhaps mentoring editors who edit lower quality articles. The value of these networks is demonstrated by the characteristics of the users who use them.

One such attempt makes extensive use of the number of views a film's Wikipedia page has attracted as a predictor of box office success in the United States. In this paper we develop a similar method of approximating box office success. We test our method using 325 films from the United States and then apply it to films from four foreign markets: Japan (95 films), Australia (118 films), Germany (105 films), and the United Kingdom (141 films). We find the technique to have inconsistent performance in these nations. While it makes relatively accurate predictions for the United States and Australia, its predictions in the remaining markets are not accurate enough to be useful.},

Users are in dire need for quality rating of the material returned in response to their queries.

Criteria used include text properties and style parameters, contributor and edit characteristics and multimedia components. In this paper we report on our ongoing work to adapt existing document assessment approaches to Arabic content with concentration on the Arabic Wikipedia and present some of the results. We also try to augment that with features specific to Arabic as well as parameters like author expertise and social media presence. One of our goals is an aggregate measure integrating many of the features into a single document quality index. We plan to use Wikipedia article quality assessment results to train general content assessment methods that can be applied to general content that lacks major Wikipedia features.},

One of the major methods for assessing Wikipedia article quality is a peer-review based method. In this method, we assume that if an editor's texts are left by the other editors, the texts are approved by the editors, then the editor is decided as a good editor. However, if an editor edits multiple articles, and the editor is approved at a small number of articles, the quality value of the editor deeply depends on the quality of the texts. In this paper, we apply h-index, which is a simple but resistant to excessive values, to the peer-review based Wikipedia article assessment method. Although h-index can identify whether an editor is a good quality editor or not, h-index cannot identify whether the editor is a vandal or an inactive editor. To solve this problem, we propose p-ratio for identifying which editors are vandals or inactive editors. From our experiments, we confirmed that by integrating h-index with p-ratio, the accuracy of article quality assessment in our method outperforms the existing peer-review based method.},

Wikidata, the structured database sister of Wikipedia, currently contains about 2.7 million explicit person records, across all language versions of the encyclopedia. These individuals, notable according to Wikipedia editing criteria, are connected via millions of hyperlinks between their respective Wikipedia articles. This situation provides us with the chance to go beyond the illustration of an idiosyncratic subset of individuals, as in the case of Priestly. In this work we summarize the overlap of nationalities and occupations, based on their co-occurrence in Wikidata individuals. We construct networks of co-occurring nationalities and occupations, provide insights into their respective community structure, and apply the results to select and color chronologically structured subsets of a large network of individuals, connected by Wikipedia hyperlinks. While the imagined communities of nationality are much more discrete in terms of co-occurrence than occupations, our quantifications reveal the existing overlap of nationality as much less clear-cut than in case of occupational domains. Our work contributes to a growing body of research using biographies of notable persons to analyze cultural processes.},

With global information exchange, the road is open to worldwide convergence of opinions and interests. However, it remains unknown to what extent interests actually have become global. To address how interests differ between countries, we analyze the information exchange in Wikipedia, the largest online collaborative encyclopedia. From the editing activity in Wikipedia, we extract the interest profiles of editors from different countries. Based on a statistical null model for interest profiles, we create a network of significant links between countries with similar interests. We show that countries are divided into 18 clusters with similar interest profiles in which language, geography, and historical background polarize the interests. Despite the opportunities of global communication, the results suggest that people nevertheless care about local information.},

Given that a previous study suggested that many of English Wikipedia's translators had neither formal training in translation nor professional work experience as translators, it is worth examining the quality of the translations produced. This paper uses Mossop's taxonomy of editing and revising procedures to explore a corpus of translated Wikipedia articles to determine how often transfer and language/style problems are present in these translations and assess how these problems are addressed.},

  abstract   = {Im Kontext aktueller Entwicklungen in der Forschungs- und Medienlandschaft ist in jüngerer Zeit mehrfach die Frage aufgeworfen worden, wie sich eine akademische Disziplin wie die Geschichtswissenschaft und ein partizipatives enzyklopädisches Projekt wie Wikipedia zueinander verhalten können. Diese Frage betrifft auch die historische oder literarische Biografik: Denn der erste Schritt, um sich einer Biographie anzunähern, ist heute oft nicht mehr die Suche in einer einschlägigen Papierenzyklopädie, sondern die Konsultierung einer Wikipedia-Seite. Obwohl es sich hier um eine wichtige Quelle biographischen Wissens handelt, ist die Autorschaft selten einer einzigen, klar identifizierbaren Person geschuldet, die Qualität der biographischen Einträge ungleich und der Inhalt damit nicht immer verlässlich. In der Tat entstehen biographische Wikipedia-Artikel unter medialen und institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen, die sich in zahlreichen Punkten von denen traditioneller akademischer Biographik unterscheiden. Der zentrale Unterschied aus wissenschaftstheoretischer Perspektive ist dabei weniger, dass Wikipedia niedrigere Qualitätsstandards hätte als die akademische Welt, sondern dass einige der Prinzipien von Wikipedia - man denke an die offene, kollaborative Autorschaft, die prinzipielle Unabgeschlossenheit der Artikel, das Ideal des "neutralen Standpunkts" oder die Verbannung von "Theoriefindung" - kaum mit dem geisteswissenschaftlichen Ethos einer expliziten und mitreflektierten persönlichen Perspektive oder mit der zentralen Bedeutung der originären Forschungsleistung des Einzelnen vereinbar scheinen. In diesem Kontext möchte der Beitrag vor allem der Frage nachgehen, wie sich die Legitimationsmechanismen gegenüber traditionellen Biographien dadurch verändern, dass nicht der Autor, sondern die Quellen als Autorität biographischen Wissens fungieren, dass akademische Reputation weniger zählt als die Kenntnis Wikipedia-interner Konventionen, und dass Anerkennung und Vertrauen als rezeptionsseitiges Korrelat von Autorität nicht ausschließlich auf detailliertester Sachkenntnis, sondern auch auf allgemeinverständlicher Darstellung beruhen. Es soll darum gehen, solchen Legitimationsmechanismen von Wikipedia-Biographien nachzugehen, wobei die hier dargelegten Überlegungen zum Verhältnis zwischen Autorschaft, Quellenbezug und Reputation auch zeigen werden, wie eng Produktion und Rezeption in Wikipedia verbunden sind. Die Analyse wird sich dabei neben den medialen Rahmenbedingungen auch auf selbst durchgeführte Experimente an biographischen Wikipedia-Artikeln stützen.},

To explore the reasons for this reluctance and to reveal their attitudes, the author polled information literacy librarians in the United States by a 26-item questionnaire that explored demographics as well as attitudes towards Web 2.0, collaborative learning strategies, and Wikipedia. The questionnaire received 281 completed responses for an 80\% return rate.   
 
This research proved that information literacy librarians provide very little Wikipedia instruction and practically no workshops solely devoted to Wikipedia.  While most respondents believe that they should be teaching students how to evaluate information responsibly in the age of Web 2.0, they most strongly disagreed when asked whether a link to Wikipedia from their library's homepage was a good idea.},

With a small number of simple ingredients, our model mimics several interesting features of real human behaviour, namely in the context of edit wars. We show that the level of conflict is determined by a tolerance parameter, which measures the editors' capability to accept different opinions and to change their own opinion. We propose to measure conflict with a parameter based on mutual reverts, which increases only in contentious situations. Using this parameter, we find a distribution for the inter-peace periods that is heavy-tailed. The effects of wiki-robots in the conflict levels and in the edition patterns are also studied. Our findings are compared with previous parameters used to measure conflicts in edit wars.},

  abstract    = {This paper advocates for the adoption of freedom of panorama in the European Union. The term “freedom of panorama” (FoP) refers to an unconditional copyright exception vis-à-vis works of architecture and sculpture placed permanently in public places. The current lack of uniformity with respect to copyright exceptions at the EU level has proven problematic to end-users, service providers and other intermediaries. It has also frustrated the ultimate goal of promoting a single internal market throughout Europe, and safeguarding freedom of expression and free movement of services throughout the EU.The current system does not harmonize copyright exceptions throughout the EU. Rather, each Member State is free to adopt copyright exceptions as it sees fit. The result is a heavily fragmented system that leaves businesses and users with the necessity to individually deal with each Member State and rights holder concerned. A mandatory exception for FoP would play a key role in guaranteeing freedom of expression, access to education and the free movement of digital services in the internal single market.FoP is critical for ensuring freedom of expression and access to education. Additionally, the growth of net companies that rely on user generated conduct (UGC), such as through YouTube, Wikipedia and blogs, has led to the constant fear among most EU citizens of violating copyright law. This reiterates the need for a FoP exception that covers both commercial and non-commercial uses. Furthermore, many new cross-border educational initiatives in Europe do not fall within the “non-commercial educational and scientific research purposes” exempted under the current InfoSoc Directive. Some national systems that broadly extend the education exception to uses that fall outside the “non-commercial” definition do not extend the exception to online uses.The EU Copyright Directive should be re-written to include a mandatory FoP provision, as is already the case in the national law of EU Member States such as the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as third countries like Brazil. This solution would also comply with copyright-protective countries’ call – among them Italy, Spain and France – for such an exhaustive list. This solution would provide clear direction to Member States without becoming an overly lengthy and unwieldy document.Several problems remain with this approach. First, there has been reticence on the part of the European Court of Human Rights to protect FoP from a freedom of expression standpoint when the images’ use was commercial. Second, there is the possibility for Member States to use trademark law, cultural heritage law, or other national laws to get around a mandatory FoP exception. The uses of trademark and cultural heritage law do not pose a significant barrier to a mandatory FoP exception at present. However, the reforms ultimately decided upon must take into account the possibility of the use of this law to frustrate the Directive’s objectives.The HEC-NYU EU Public Interest Clinic (the “Clinic”) presents its justifications for a mandatory FoP exception below. We also include an annex and model legislation that addresses many of the deficiencies of current EU law.},

As the number of clusters is relatively small we use manual analyses to detect science articles. In addition we identify the most representative scientific fields and their main features. We conclude that science articles are about 11.66 \% of Spanish Wikipedia articles and that the most important clusters of scientific articles do not always coincide with classical Science disciplines.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Electronic sources of medical information are plentiful, and numerous studies have demonstrated the use of the Internet by patients and the variable reliability of these sources. Studies have investigated neither the use of web-based resources by residents, nor the reliability of the information available on these websites.
METHODS: A web-based survey was distributed to surgical residents in Michigan and third- and fourth-year medical students at an American allopathic and osteopathic medical school and a Caribbean allopathic school regarding their preferred sources of medical information in various situations. A set of 254 queries simulating those faced by medical trainees on rounds, on a written examination, or during patient care was developed. The top 5 electronic resources cited by the trainees were evaluated for their ability to answer these questions accurately, using standard textbooks as the point of reference.
RESULTS: The respondents reported a wide variety of overall preferred resources. Most of the 73 responding medical trainees favored textbooks or board review books for prolonged studying, but electronic resources are frequently used for quick studying, clinical decision-making questions, and medication queries. The most commonly used electronic resources were UpToDate, Google, Medscape, Wikipedia, and Epocrates. UpToDate and Epocrates had the highest percentage of correct answers (47\%) and Wikipedia had the lowest (26\%). Epocrates also had the highest percentage of wrong answers (30\%), whereas Google had the lowest percentage (18\%). All resources had a significant number of questions that they were unable to answer.
DISCUSSION: Though hardcopy books have not been completely replaced by electronic resources, more than half of medical students and nearly half of residents prefer web-based sources of information. For quick questions and studying, both groups prefer Internet sources. However, the most commonly used electronic resources fail to answer clinical queries more than half of the time and have an alarmingly high rate of inaccurate information.},

  title      = {The political economy of wilkiality: a {South} {African} inquiry into knowledge and power on wikipedia},
  year       = {2014},
  abstract   = {This dissertation explores how knowledge construction on the English-language Wikipedia produces hegemonic representations of South Africa. Using Wikipedia's entries on Cape Town and various places in the Free State province as case studies, this dissertation demonstrates through critical discourse analysis that there is a systematic marginalisation, underrepresentation, and decontextualisation of 'black' working class communities and spaces, which echoes their historical marginalisation. This representation is contextualised through a historical narrative of Cape Town and the Free State, and explored against a theoretical background which, borrowing from Foucault, Castells, and others, sees the social construction of knowledge as an expression of power, and the networked society as an arena for the dynamics of hegemony. While Wikipedia is often hailed as a game-changer, the knowledge it produces tends to replicate and, thanks to its ever-increasing reach, further entrench hegemonic explanations of society. This might seem counter-intuitive given its credentials as a democratiser of knowledge, but can be explained with Wikipedia's architecture, which ultimately rests upon a regime of truth established during the Enlightenment. The online encyclopedia relies on well-established institutions and discourses of knowledge as sources of its content, and these, coupled with its particular preferences for some sources and topics over others, give it a particular slant in favour of the hegemonic status quo. The discourse it produces is given further gravitas and is naturalised through an insistence upon the knowledge it presents as 'neutral'. Studies have shown that Wikipedia's values are defined by its established community of editors and that, even as Wikipedia's reach is extending, it is increasingly difficult for new users to impact upon the online encyclopedia. Arguably it is rather the encyclopedia which impacts upon them by circulating seemingly uncontested representations of their communities, or, alternatively, simply ignoring the communities altogether. In a process I have, borrowing from American political satirist Stephen Colbert, termed wikiality, hegemonic representations have a tendency of becoming true when we act upon them as such. Thus, when certain communities are presented as marginal or unimportant, it becomes even more difficult for them to break out of this mould. Meaningful participation on Wikipedia can only be achieved if the user not only has access to relevant technological capital, but also the cultural capital required to make contributions which appeal to the established core of editors. In South Africa, as a result of its political economy, large parts of the population are politically, economically, and socially marginalised. This also means that they lack the cultural capital necessary to make meaningful contributions to Wikipedia. This tends to render them the subjects of Wikipedia entries, rather than their authors, which contributes to their further marginalisation. The key to understanding the relationship between knowledge and power on Wikipedia lies in the ability of some users to capture and define reality through representation and thereby effectuating it. Reducing this imbalance to a simple question of access downplays the social, economic, and political factors which created it in the first place, and accommodates discursive practices which downplay difference and perpetuate hegemony.},

  abstract   = {Over the past decade, the paradigm of the World Wide Web has shifted from static web pages towards participatory and collaborative content production. The main properties of this user generated content are a low publication threshold and little or no editorial control. While this has improved the variety and timeliness of the available information, it causes an even higher variance in quality than the already heterogeneous quality of traditional web content. Wikipedia is the prime example for a successful, large-scale, collaboratively created resource that reflects the spirit of the open collaborative content creation paradigm.
Even though recent studies have confirmed that the overall quality of Wikipedia is high, there is still a wide gap that must be bridged before Wikipedia reaches the state of a reliable, citable source.

A key prerequisite to reaching this goal is a quality management strategy that can cope both with the massive scale of Wikipedia and its open and almost anarchic nature. This includes an efficient communication platform for work coordination among the collaborators as well as techniques for monitoring quality problems across the encyclopedia. This dissertation
shows how natural language processing approaches can be used to assist information quality management on a massive scale.

In the first part of this thesis, we establish the theoretical foundations for our work. We first introduce the relatively new concept of open online collaboration with a particular focus on collaborative writing and proceed with a detailed discussion of Wikipedia and its role as an encyclopedia, a community, an online collaboration platform, and a knowledge resource for language technology applications. We then proceed with the three main contributions of this thesis.

Even though there have been previous attempts to adapt existing information quality frameworks to Wikipedia, no quality model has yet incorporated writing quality as a central
factor. Since Wikipedia is not only a repository of mere facts but rather consists of full text articles, the writing quality of these articles has to be taken into consideration when judging article quality. As the first main contribution of this thesis, we therefore define a comprehensive article quality model that aims to consolidate both the quality of writing and the quality criteria defined in multiple Wikipedia guidelines and policies into a single model. The model comprises 23 dimensions segmented into the four layers of intrinsic quality, contextual quality, writing quality and organizational quality. 

As a second main contribution, we present an approach for automatically identifying quality flaws in Wikipedia articles. Even though the general idea of quality detection has been introduced in previous work, we dissect the approach to find that the task is inherently prone to a topic bias which results in unrealistically high cross-validated evaluation results that do not reflect the classifier’s real performance on real world data. 

We solve this problem with a novel data sampling approach based on the full article revision history that is able to avoid this bias. It furthermore allows us not only to identify flawed articles but also to find reliable counterexamples that do not exhibit the respective quality flaws. For automatically detecting quality flaws in unseen articles, we present FlawFinder, a modular system for supervised text classification. We evaluate the system on a novel corpus of Wikipedia articles with neutrality and style flaws. The results confirm the initial hypothesis that the reliable classifiers tend to exhibit a lower cross-validated performance than the biased ones but the scores more closely resemble their actual performance
in the wild.

As a third main contribution, we present an approach for automatically segmenting and tagging the user contributions on article Talk pages to improve the work coordination among Wikipedians. These unstructured discussion pages are not easy to navigate and information is likely to get lost over time in the discussion archives. By automatically identifying the quality problems that have been discussed in the past and the solutions that have been proposed, we can help users to make informed decisions in the future. 

Our contribution in this area is threefold: (i) We describe a novel algorithm for segmenting the unstructured dialog on Wikipedia Talk pages using their revision history. In contrast to related work, which mainly relies on the rudimentary markup, this new algorithm can reliably extract meta data, such as the identity of a user, and is moreover able to handle discontinuous turns. (ii) We introduce a novel scheme for annotating the turns in article discussions with dialog act labels for capturing the coordination efforts of article improvement. The labels reflect the types of criticism discussed in a turn, for example missing information or inappropriate language, as well as any actions proposed for solving the quality problems. (iii) Based on this scheme, we created two automatically segmented and manually annotated discussion corpora extracted from the Simple English Wikipedia (SEWD) and the English Wikipedia (EWD). We evaluate how well text classification approaches can learn to assign the dialog act labels from our scheme to unseen discussion pages and achieve a cross-validated performance of F1 = 0.82 on the SEWD corpus while we obtain an average performance of F1 = 0.78 on the larger and more complex EWD corpus.},

Furthermore, previous studies ascribed a “knowledge sharing” label to Wikipedia content editors. However, in this work, Wikipedia can be viewed as a platform that let individuals to show their expertise. This study investigates the underlying reasons that drive individuals to edit Wikipedia content. Based on expectation-confirmation theory and expectancy-value theory for achievement motivations, we propose an integrated model that incorporates psychological and contextual perspectives. Wikipedians from the English-language Wikipedia site were invited to survey. Partial least square (PLS) was applied to test our proposed model. Analytical results indicated and confirmed that subjective task value, commitment, and procedural justice were signiﬁcant to satisfaction of Wikipedians; and satisfaction significantly influenced continuance intention to edit Wikipedia content.},

We study the biographical Wikipedia pages of a large data set of authors, composers, and lyricists to determine whether the public domain status of available images leads to a higher rate of inclusion of illustrated supplementary material and whether such inclusion increases visitorship to individual pages. We attempt to objectively place a value on the body of public domain photographs and illustrations which are used in this global resource. We find that the most historically remote subjects are more likely to have images on their web pages because their biographical life-spans pre-date the existence of in-copyright imagery.  We find that the large majority of photos and illustrations used on subject pages were obtained from the public domain, and we estimate their value in terms of costs saved to Wikipedia page builders and in terms of increased traffic corresponding to the inclusion of an image.  Then, extrapolating from the characteristics of a random sample of a further 300 Wikipedia pages, we estimate a total value of public domain photographs on Wikipedia of between \$246 to \$270 million dollars per year.},

The quality of knowledge artifacts (e.g. article, source code file) is deeply tied to their individual expertise, and to their ability to collaborate well. Conversely, the expertise of contributors is a function of artifacts contributed to. Building upon a large stream of literature on the measurement of article quality and contributor expertise, we propose a recursive algorithm to measure how editor expertise influences the quality of articles, and how contributions to articles influence editor expertise. This bi-partite network random walker metric reveals the specific structure of cooperation and how the quality of articles is achieved through coordination. We show that while the wisdom of crowds is well pulled in some categories, more editors per article can also create disvalue.},

An in-depth corpus analysis lays the groundwork for research and development on automatic vandalism detection in public knowledge bases. Our analysis shows that 58\% of the vandalism revisions can be found in the textual portions of Wikidata, and the remainder in structural content, e.g., subject-predicate-object triples. Moreover, we find that some vandals also target Wikidata content whose manipulation may impact content displayed on Wikipedia, revealing potential vulnerabilities.

The article argues that in addition to viewing technology as means to acquire subject-related learning, teacher education also needs to include an explicit focus on technology as a topic in itself. This article presents a Wikipedia editing assignment in Social Science for a group of first-year student teachers. A range of data are used to analyze some of the self-reported insights that open up to the students when they themselves become contributors of content they normally deal with exclusively as consumers. The study shows that although the students make a series of discoveries after becoming editors, they do not fully comprehend all the complexities of a massively collaborative tool like Wikipedia. The article argues that the assignment nevertheless provides the students with a significant and rare opportunity to address the use of digital technology, in a way that is both relevant and feasible within the frames of subject teaching and of teacher education.Keywords: professional digital competence, teacher education, student teachers, Wikipedia, wikis, digital tools, digital skills},

  abstract    = {Geographies of codified knowledge have always been characterized by stark core-periphery patterns: with some parts of the world at the center of global voice and representation, and many others invisible or unheard. However, many have pointed to the potential for radical change as digital divides are bridged and 2.5 billion people are now online. With a focus on Wikipedia, which is one of the world’s most visible, most used, and most powerful repositories of user-generated content, we investigate whether we are now seeing fundamentally different patterns of knowledge production. Even though Wikipedia consists of a massive cloud of geographic information about millions of events and places around the globe put together by millions of hours of human labor, it remains that the encyclopedia is characterized by uneven and clustered geographies: there is simply not a lot of content about much of the world. The paper then moves to describe the factors that explain these patterns, showing that while just a few conditions can explain much of the variance in geographies of information some parts of the world remain well below their expected values. These findings indicate that better connectivity is only a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for the presence of volunteered geographic information about a place. We conclude by discussing the remaining social, economic, political, regulatory, and infrastructural barriers that continue to disadvantage many of the world’s informational peripheries. The paper ultimately shows that, despite many hopes that a democratization of connectivity will spur a concomitant democratization of information production, internet connectivity is not a panacea, and can only ever be one part of a broader strategy to deepen the informational layers of places.},

These workshops also served as forms of capacity building.In general, we believe that editing Wikipedia is an intensive task that is dominated by the global North and replete with a great deal of barriers to entry. It is nevertheless a key activity for future development of a stable information ecology within the MENA region. This is especially valid given how extensively Wikipedia is used across the web in sites such as Facebook and Google.We believe that capacity building among key Wikipedians can create greater understanding and offset much of the emotional labour required to sustain activity on the site in the face of intense arguments and ideological biases. However, we also believe that a distinct lack of sources both owning to a lack of legitimacy for MENA journalism and a paucity of open access government documents inhibit further growth in this area. Future work should be dedicated to these issues of support for active existing Wikipedians and knowledge sharing of Canada’s best practices in information sharing to facilitate accelerated growth of geographic content in the MENA region. But the ultimate difference will come from increased diffusion of broadband internet technology as demonstrated through several statistical models. We articulate local exceptions to this rule, but remain committed to an overall strategy of capacity building and broadband diffusion.},

  abstract = {Fame, popularity and celebrity status, frequently used tokens of success, are often loosely related to, or even divorced from professional performance. This dichotomy is partly rooted in the difficulty to distinguish performance, an individual measure that captures the actions of a performer, from success, a collective measure that captures a community's reactions to these actions. Yet, finding the relationship between the two measures is essential for all areas that aim to objectively reward excellence, from science to business. Here we quantify the relationship between performance and success by focusing on tennis, an individual sport where the two quantities can be independently measured. We show that a predictive model, relying only on a tennis player's performance in tournaments, can accurately predict an athlete's popularity, both during a player's active years and after retirement. Hence the model establishes a direct link between performance and momentary popularity. The agreement between the performance-driven and observed popularity suggests that in most areas of human achievement exceptional visibility may be rooted in detectable performance measures.},

We found that factors like article topic and unanimity (or lack thereof) were among the factors that tended to affect the outcome of the debate.

  title    = {What is the value of anonymous communication?},
  abstract = {What does the fact that Tor users can’t edit wikipedia mean for the quality of the ``encyclopedia that anyone can edit?’’ How do captchas and blocking of anonymity services affect the experiences of Tor users when they are trying to contribute content? This talk will discuss the increasing limitations of active participation in the anonymous Internet and the findings of our interview study of Tor users and wikipedia editors concerning these issues. We believe that by understanding the contributions Tor users make—and that people denied access to anonymity tools don't make—we can help make the case for the value of anonymity online.

The belief that a free and open Internet enables people to accomplish great things together is at the core of projects like Wikipedia, open source software, and online political activism. The term “peer production” has been used for years to describe a new kind of collaborative project-—one that is facilitated by the Internet and in which people self-organize to create things they value, whether that’s software, encyclopedias, news, maps, or just about anything else. But research about these projects and how they work generally doesn't take into account the value of anonymous participation.

Moderating user-generated or peer-produced content has challenges and many services (Yelp, Google, Wikipedia, Cloudflare, etc) have turned to third party blacklists, real-name policies, and banning users of anonymity networks like Tor to handle real and perceived abuse issues. 
The result of such decisions in aggregate means that the Internet offers uneven opportunities for participation and engagement. It’s easy to imagine anonymous participants as only jerks and trolls, but much harder to quantify the contributions that don’t happen when anonymity is banned or made more difficult.

We interviewed Tor users about their participation in peer production projects and Wikipedia editors about their privacy concerns. In this talk, we will share stories about the contributions of anonymous participants and the chilling effects of limiting anonymity ---topics not edited and people silenced.},

We proposed that masculine norms for behavior in Wikipedia, which may be further exacerbated by the disinhibiting nature of an online, anonymous environment, lead to different psychological experiences for women and men, which, in turn, explain gender differences in contribution behavior. We hypothesized that, among a sample of individuals who occasionally contribute to Wikipedia, women would report less confidence in their expertise, more discomfort with editing others’ work, and more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men, all of which are crucial aspects of contributing to Wikipedia. We also hypothesized that gender differences in these psychological experiences would explain women’s lower contribution rate compared to men in this sample. We analyzed data from a sample of 1,598 individuals in the United States who completed the English version of an international survey of Wikipedia users and readers conducted in 2008 and who reported being occasional contributors. Significant gender differences were found in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict) and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men. Mediation analyses revealed that confidence in expertise and discomfort with editing partially mediated the gender difference in number of articles edited, the standard measure for contribution to Wikipedia. Implications for the gender gap in Wikipedia and in organizations more generally are discussed.},

online science sites (e.g. NASA) (45\%). When asked where they got
information for course assignments, most reported from assigned readings
(82\%) but a large percentage still reported getting information from
online sources such as internet searches (60\%), Wikipedia (30\%) and

positive correlation between those who reported that they liked science

The following Wikipedia articles were considered: Alzheimer's disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Dementia; Epilepsy; Epileptic seizure; Migraine; Multiple sclerosis; Parkinson's disease; Stroke; Traumatic brain injury. We analyzed information regarding the total article views for 90 days and the rank of these articles among all those available in Wikipedia. We determined the highest search volume peaks to identify possible relation with online news headlines. No relation between incidence or prevalence of neurological disorders and the search volume for the related articles was found. Seven out of 10 neurological conditions showed relations in search volume peaks and news headlines. Six out of these seven peaks were related to news about famous people suffering from neurological disorders, especially those from showbusiness. Identification of discrepancies between disease burden and health seeking behavior on Wikipedia is useful in the planning of public health campaigns. Celebrities who publicly announce their neurological diagnosis might effectively promote awareness programs, increase public knowledge and reduce stigma related to diagnoses of neurological disorders.},

Through discussions of edit wars, article deletion policies, user access levels, and more, Tkacz enables us to see how the key concepts of openness—including collaboration, ad-hocracy, and the splitting of contested projects through “forking”—play out in reality.       The resulting book is the richest critical analysis of openness to date, one that roots media theory in messy reality and thereby helps us move beyond the vaporware promises of digital utopians and take the first steps toward truly understanding what openness does, and does not, have to offer.},

  abstract = {The dissemination of knowledge about (agro)biodiversity is a strategic factor in communicating the urgent need to defend and protect biological diversity. Although this can be carried out with various media, in recent years social media (or “Web 2.0”) have begun to assume a prominent role. Of the Web 2.0 services, Wikipedia (Wikimedia Foundation, San Francisco, CA) is one of the most powerful and interesting tools, for several reasons, being collaborative by nature, free of charge, multilingual, and accessible online; in addition, anyone can update the materials therein. Within the framework of the regional project “Rural Development Programme 2007-2013,” our research group, responsible of the collection of historical information and morphological characterization of several vegetable crops considered to be at risk of genetic erosion, proposed the use of Wikipedia as a dissemination tool. The objective of this study was to show how to add/modify articles in Wikipedia for online divulgation and to demonstrate its validity by analyzing some data (pageviews, editing history, and the impact of Wikipedia as a referral toward the project’s institutional website) related to the Wikipedia articles that were added/modified. The article about the landrace variety Carota di Polignano carrot (Daucus carota), created from scratch, received more than 15,000 pageviews in less than 2 years. Referrals from Wikipedia increased the visits to the institutional website by 30\%, whereas the bounce rate decreased by 15\%. Wikipedia may be a good tool to improve the dissemination of knowledge about (agro)biodiversity either online or offline, and the addition in Wikipedia’s pages of scientific journal references and of links to projects’ website may strengthen the diffusion of scientific knowledge.},

main objective to understand how during the campaign to elect the mayor of São Paulo city in 2012 users
have accessed articles related to the three leading candidates – Russomanno, Haddad and Serra – and
have edited them. We consider the period from 2008 to 2012 as a reference to explore variables such as
the page view indices and the number of editions provided by frequent users. It was concluded that the
intensification of the political battle during the election period affects the number of access to such articles,
their editions, and the nature of the interaction between registered editors.},

Using these simple ingredients, it is possible to reproduce the results obtained for Wikipedia edition dynamics for a collection of single pages as well as the averaged results. Using a stochastic process framework, a recursive equation was obtained for the average of the number of editions per editor that seems to describe the editing behaviour in Wikipedia.},

On 18th January 2012 in the ‘first Internet strike’ against the American ‘Stop Online Piracy Act' legislation, over two thousand Wikipedians took part in the vote concerning whether their site should undertake a protest action, with vast majority expressing support for this action. However, the vote participants formed only a tiny fraction of the total number of Wikipedians who number in millions. Although Wikipedia can be seen as an open, democratic forum practicing deliberative, direct democracy, the process of voting on Wikipedia is significantly influenced by participation inequality, with a majority of the vote participation coming from a small group of most active contributors – an effective oligarchy. This paper discusses the intricate dynamics between Wikipedia egalitarian ethos and the creed to discuss project matters deliberately on one hand and the conspicuous lack of promotion and advertisement stemming from a rule against ‘canvassing’ and an overall skepticism regarding the status of majority votes. While voters' passivity and lack of interest play a major role, as expected, another factor emerges as a significant factor responsible for the low levels of participation: an inefficient information distribution system, as the vast majority of Wikipedians were not aware of the ongoing discussions and the vote itself until after their conclusion.},

  abstract  = {Qu’est-ce que Wikipédia ? À cette question, dans les milieux académiques et d’expertise comme dans les cercles médiatiques, les réponses divergent. Certains remettent en cause son statut d’encyclopédie, arguant que, créé par des « amateurs » et dépourvu de hiérarchisation explicite des savoirs, le portail des connaissances ne saurait se prévaloir de cette qualité. D’autres y trouvent au contraire de grandes similitudes épistémologiques avec les encyclopédies traditionnelles, minimisant ainsi ses aspects innovants. Mais ce débat sémantique montre des signes d’essoufflement. Il semble plus pertinent de voir Wikipédia comme un projet qui s’améliore au fur et à mesure, donnant naissance à un « encyclopédisme d’usage », et n’ayant donc pas vocation à être comparé à une encyclopédie traditionnelle.Comme l’indique son titre, l’ouvrage proposé ici assume le fait de traiter d’un objet innovant difficile à classer et encore plus à classifier. Mais, ne serait-ce que par l’ampleur de son développement et de son influence dans le monde de l’éducation et de la recherche, Wikipédia s’impose comme un objet scientifique à part entière. Les Anglo-Saxons s’en sont emparés les premiers en créant les Wikipedia studies, pan intégré des Wiki studies mises en lumière chaque année par une grande conférence académique internationale, « Wikimania » et des colloques spécialisés « Wikisym ». Ce volume n’est donc pas focalisé autour des débats clivants, « pro » ou « anti » Wikipédia – même s’il nous a paru nécessaire d’aborder une synthèse de la question. Il s’agit davantage d’une tentative de circonscrire l’objet dans sa complexité épistémique à travers son évolution permanente, et de l’aborder comme un laboratoire scientifique pluridisciplinaire, pour mieux en comprendre les arcanes.Les chercheurs d’aujourd’hui ne peuvent pas ne pas s’intéresser à cet objet singulier qu’est Wikipédia. C’est au fond la raison d’être de cet ouvrage : aider à dépasser le « traumatisme cognitif » pour s’approprier l’encyclopédie et l’aborder comme un nouvel horizon épistémologique. Dans un contexte d’emballement technologique global, nous ne savons pas combien de temps la forme actuelle de Wikipédia perdurera. Mais les enjeux scientifiques nés avec l’encyclopédie collaborative marquent une transition médiatico-historique qui bouleverse profondément la relation à la connaissance, et dans une certaine mesure la connaissance elle-même. Non seulement ces enjeux se prolongeront dans un univers informationnel de plus en plus décentralisé, mais ils seront décuplés dans le cadre d’une mondialisation devenue terrain de bataille de multiples sphères d’influences culturelles et scientifiques.},

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continuously monitor the amount of influenza that is present in the American population and compiles this information in weekly reports. However, because it can take a long time to collect and analyze all of this information, the data that is being reported each week is typically between 1–2 weeks old at the time of publishing. For this reason, we are interested in developing new techniques to determine the amount of influenza in the population that are accurate, can return results in real-time, and can be used to supplement traditional monitoring. We have created a method of estimating the amount of influenza-like illness in the American population, at any time of year, by analyzing the amount of Internet traffic seen on certain influenza-related Wikipedia articles. This method is able to accurately estimate the percentage of Americans with influenza-like illness, in real-time, and is robust to influenza seasons that are more severe than normal and to events that promote much media attention, such as the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.},

  abstract = {This paper considers Wikipedia and collaborative editing in general: what is Wikipedia, how does it work as a collaborative editing project? Who publishes there, how do these people collaborate, is there a hierarchy among them? And what about Wikipedia quality control: is it efficient, how good is the factual quality of the content?
Can Wikipedia even be re-used for academic work - and if so, where and how? How does Wikipedia cope with new research findings; can they be found on the platform? What influence does Wikipedia have on research and education; how should universities cope with the fact that open knowledge can be found there within a matter of seconds?
This paper addresses the issue in a rather hands-on and down-to-earth approach that will allow us to draw some interesting conclusions about the role of open Internet knowledge (such as that which can be found on Wikipedia) for learning and knowledge creation. We will be placing a special focus on academia: for instance, how should universities define “knowledge” at a time when so many answers can be readily found on Wikipedia? Here the paper does not strive to come to generalized conclusions, but it does strive to find some modest, surprising and - last but not least - also practical answers.
The current paper is based on library research, an online analysis of the current Wikipedia website, and a number of interviews with Swiss Wikipedia activists.},

  abstract = {Wikipedia is a multi-language and wealth-content online encyclopedia. Based on the concept of Web2.0, Wikipedia allows anyone to share and edit Wikipedia content, which also makes Wikipedia easily to be destroyed. Therefore, all Wikipedians pay long-term sustained effort on maintaining the quality of Wikipedia content. The past research directions for Wikipedia vandalism detection focused on the text semantic, feature statistical and machine learning. The current directions focus on language-independent feature analysis and continuity content-context correlation analysis. WikiSERM extracts the key-item based on the Wikipedia edit tag which applies to various languages of Wikipedia. Therefore key-item based on the Wikipedia edit tag has the language-independent feature, and it makes WikiSERM be applied in various language versions of Wikipedia vandalism detection. WikiSERM take the full version of the article as evidence to judge risk trends and to analyze using-status of each key item in a Wikipedia article (e.g., keeps being used or completely deleted). Through analysis of the continuity of key item using-status, we can get risk status of each key item in each corresponding revision. WikiSERM records those risk results of previous revision as two-dimensional array for querying quickly, therefore WikiSERM has the ability to deal with the incremental data and to provide the risk assessment result immediately. Through the analysis of key item transaction in the Wikipedia revision (e.g., add high-risk key item, add low-risk key item, delete high-risk key item, delete low-risk key item), WikiSERM take those over-threshold revisions as a high risk version. Our approach can help Wikipedia administrators to quickly find vandalism revision, and identify which is the high-risk key item in the vandalism revision.},

  abstract    = {Most law school assignments are produced and consumed in a dyadic relationship of student-writer and instructor-reader. But consider a different scenario, one in which the fate of the work is presumptive publication to the world; in which feedback from any interested reader is potentially instantaneous; in which the instructor’s role is that of coach or mentor through the writing and publishing process as well as assessor of the work; and in which the student’s work, in turn, contributes to providing worldwide access to free legal information. The world we are talking about is that of writing or editing Wikipedia articles for law school credit. In this Article, we describe that world and the small part we played in it as law professor and law student in editing a Wikipedia article as an optional component of an upper-year Canadian law school course.In Part I, we set out some of the background to Wikipedia. This includes a discussion of its history, philosophy and policies; the relationship between Wikipedia and higher education; and the relationship between Wikipedia and law. In this Part, we make a pedagogical case for turning law students from “consumers” to “producers” of Wikipedia’s legal content. In Part II, we talk about what we did as professor and student in the course, focusing on the editing of a specific Wikipedia “stub” article — that is, an article clearly in need of editing and further development. In Part III, we consider the assessment of student contributions to Wikipedia. This includes a discussion of various rubrics and the Wikipedia Education Project Syllabus, which provides a general template for a twelve-week course emphasizing Wikipedia content. Part IV summarizes our reflections on the exercise, including both its limitations and opportunities. The Appendix provides some links to resources for professors and students who want to experiment with writing or editing Wikipedia articles for law school credit.},

  abstract   = {In the past 15 years, the rapid development of web technologies has created novel ways of collaborative editing. Open online platforms have attracted millions of users from all over the world. The open encyclopedia Wikipedia, started in 2001, has become a very prominent example of a largely successful platform for collaborative editing and knowledge creation. The wiki model has enabled collaboration at a new scale, with more than 30,000 monthly active users on the English Wikipedia.
Traditional writing research deals with questions concerning revision and the writing process itself. The analysis of collaborative writing additionally raises questions about the interaction of the involved authors. Interaction takes place when authors write on the same document (indirect interaction), or when they coordinate the collaborative writing process by means of communication (direct interaction). The study of collaborative writing in online mass collaboration poses several interesting challenges. First and foremost, the writing process in open online collaboration is typically characterized by a large number of revisions from many different authors. Therefore, it is important to understand the interplay and the sequences of different revision categories. As the quality of documents produced in a collaborative writing process varies greatly, the relationship between collaborative revision and document quality is an important field of study. Furthermore, the impact of direct user interaction through background discussions on the collaborative writing process is largely unknown. In this thesis, we tackle these challenges in the context of online mass collaboration, using one of the largest collaboratively created resources, Wikipedia, as our data source. We will also discuss to which extent our conclusions are valid beyond Wikipedia.
We will be dealing with three aspects of collaborative writing in Wikipedia. First, we carry out a content-oriented analysis of revisions in the Wikipedia revision history. This includes the segmentation of article revisions into human-interpretable edits. We develop a taxonomy of edit categories such as spelling error corrections, vandalism or information adding, and verify our taxonomy in an annotation study on a corpus of edits from the English and German Wikipedia. We use the annotated corpora as training data to create models which enable the automatic classification of edits. To show that our model is able to generalize beyond our own data, we train and test it on a second corpus of English Wikipedia revisions. We analyze the distribution of edit categories and frequent patterns in edit sequences within a larger set of article revisions. We also assess the relationship between edit categories and article quality, finding that the information content in high-quality articles tends to become more stable after their promotion and that high-quality articles show a higher degree of homogeneity with respect to frequent collaboration patterns as compared to random articles.
Second, we investigate activity-based roles of users in Wikipedia and how they relate to the collaborative writing process. We automatically classify all revisions in a representative sample of Wikipedia articles and cluster users in this sample into seven intuitive roles. The roles are based on the editing behavior of the users. We find roles such as Vandals, Watchdogs, or All-round Contributors. We also analyze the stability of our discovered roles across time and analyze role transitions. The results show that although the nature of roles remains stable across time, more than half of the users in our sample changed their role between two time periods.
Third, we analyze the correspondence between indirect user interaction through collaborative editing and direct user interaction through background discussion. We analyze direct user interaction using the notion of turns, which has been established in previous work. Turns are snippets from Wikipedia discussion pages. We introduce the notion of corresponding edit-turn-pairs. A corresponding edit-turn-pair consists of a turn and an edit from the same Wikipedia article; the turn forms an explicit performative and the edit corresponds to this performative. This happens, for example, when a user complains about a missing reference in the discussion about an article, and another user adds an appropriate reference to the article itself. We identify the distinctive properties of corresponding edit-turn-pairs and use them to create a model for the automatic detection of corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs. We show that the percentage of corresponding edit-turn-pairs in a corpus of flawed English Wikipedia articles is typically below 5\% and varies considerably across different articles.
The thesis is concluded with a summary of our main contributions and findings. The growing number of collaborative platforms in commercial applications and education, e.g. in massive open online learning courses, demonstrates the need to understand the collaborative writing process and to support collaborating authors. We also discuss several open issues with respect to the questions addressed in the main parts of the thesis and point out possible directions for future work. Many of the experiments we carried out in the course of this thesis rely on supervised text classification. In the appendix, we explain the concepts and technologies underlying these experiments. We also introduce the DKPro TC framework, which was substantially extended as part of this thesis.},

However, some wiiki–based sites, such as Wikipedia, are so popular that they have become a favorite target of spammers and other vandals. In such popular sites, human vigilance is not enough to combat vandalism, and tools that detect possible vandalism and poor-quality contributions become a necessity. The application of machine learning techniques holds promise for developing efficient online algorithms for better tools to assist users in vandalism detection. We describe an efficient and accurate classifier that performs vandalism detection in UGC sites. We show the results of our classifier in the PAN Wikipedia dataset. We explore the effectiveness of a combination of 66 individual features that produce an AUC of 0.9553 on a test dataset – the best result to our knowledge. Using Lasso optimization we then reduce our feature–rich model to a much smaller and more efficient model of 28 features that performs almost as well – the drop in AUC being only 0.005. We describe how this approach can be generalized to other user generated content systems and describe several applications of this classifier to help users identify potential vandalism.},

  abstract  = {The continuous success of Wikipedia depends upon its capability to recruit and engage new editors, especially those with new knowledge and perspectives. Yet Wikipedia over the years has become a complicated bureaucracy that may be difficult for newcomers to navigate. Mentoring is a practice that has been widely used in offline organizations to help new members adjust to their roles. In this paper, we draw insights from the offline mentoring literature to analyze mentoring practices in Wikipedia and how they influence editor behaviors. Our quantitative analysis of the Adopt-a-user program shows mixed success of the program. Communication between adopters and adoptees is correlated with the amount of article editing done by adoptees shortly after adoption. Our qualitative analysis of the communication between adopters and adoptees suggests that several key functions of mentoring are missing or not fulfilled consistently. Most adopters focus on establishing their legitimacy rather than acting proactively to guide, protect, and support the long-term growth of adoptees. We conclude with recommendations of how Wikipedia mentoring programs can evolve to take advantage of offline best practices.},

advertising and promotion are strictly forbidden in Wikipedia, and advertising articles will be deleted by administrators manually. Currently most
researches about spamming in Wikipedia are focusing on editing behavior and making use of user’s edit history to do feature-based judging. In
this paper, we propose a pure text-based method to automatically detect advertising and promotion articles in Wikipedia. In order to apply
learning algorithms to training corpus, we need to transform text article into a vector form. Rather than traditional bag-of-words document vector
representation which was proved to be inefficient, we employ a deep learning method to obtain a word vector for each word and then apply a
sliding window on each document to gradually gain the document vector. Furthermore, we implement an improved deep-learning structure
which can directly give us a document vector for each document. We then construct a supervised SVM classifier on the document vectors to
obtain the final results. Our method was tested on several datasets and produced better performance than the bag-of-words model in both
precision and recall measurements.},

When inserted into an article, these objects are intended to simultaneously notify editors about missing or weak elements of the article and to add articles to particular categories of work. This categorization practice enables editors to collaborate iteratively with one another because each object signals work that needs to be done by others in order to fill in the gaps of the current content. In addition to this functional value, however, categorization also has a number of symbolic and political consequences. Editors are engaged in a continual practice of iterative summation that contributes to an active construction of the event as it happens rather than a mere assembling of ‘reliable sources’. The deployment and removal of cleanup tags can be seen as an act of power play between editors that affects readers’ evaluation of the article’s content. Infoboxes are similar sites of struggle whose deployment and development result in an erasure of the contradictions and debates that gave rise to them. These objects illuminate how this novel journalistic practice has important implications for the way that political events are represented.},

In this article, we propose an integrated system to extract both parallel sentences and fragments from comparable corpora. We first apply parallel sentence extraction to identify parallel sentences from comparable sentences. We then extract parallel fragments from the comparable sentences. Parallel sentence extraction is based on a parallel sentence candidate filter and classifier for parallel sentence identification. We improve it by proposing a novel filtering strategy and three novel feature sets for classification. Previous studies have found it difficult to accurately extract parallel fragments from comparable sentences. We propose an accurate parallel fragment extraction method that uses an alignment model to locate the parallel fragment candidates and an accurate lexicon-based filter to identify the truly parallel fragments. A case study on the Chinese--Japanese Wikipedia indicates that our proposed methods outperform previously proposed methods, and the parallel data extracted by our system significantly improves SMT performance.},

  abstract = {Wikipedia is a free Internet encyclopedia with an enormous amount of content. This encyclopedia is written by volunteers with various backgrounds in a collective fashion; anyone can access and edit most of the articles. This open-editing nature may give us prejudice that Wikipedia is an unstable and unreliable source; yet many studies suggest that Wikipedia is even more accurate and self-consistent than traditional encyclopedias. Scholars have attempted to understand such extraordinary credibility, but usually used the number of edits as the unit of time, without consideration of real time. In this work, we probe the formation of such collective intelligence through a systematic analysis using the entire history of 34534110 English Wikipedia articles, between 2001 and 2014. From this massive data set, we observe the universality of both timewise and lengthwise editing scales, which suggests that it is essential to consider the real-time dynamics. By considering real time, we find the existence of distinct growth patterns that are unobserved by utilizing the number of edits as the unit of time. To account for these results, we present a mechanistic model that adopts the article editing dynamics based on both editor-editor and editor-article interactions. The model successfully generates the key properties of real Wikipedia articles such as distinct types of articles for the editing patterns characterized by the interrelationship between the numbers of edits and editors, and the article size. In addition, the model indicates that infrequently referred articles tend to grow faster than frequently referred ones, and articles attracting a high motivation to edit counterintuitively reduce the number of participants. We suggest that this decay of participants eventually brings inequality among the editors, which will become more severe with time.},

Drawing on literature from death studies and peer production, we demonstrate how the creation of these "wiki-bituaries" requires complex coordination work and highlight processes of commemoration and memorialization within socio-technical systems. Using the corpus of 6,132 articles about people who died in 2012, we examine the network relationships and contribution dynamics of users who perform this work and identify behavioral and content dynamics on the biographical articles about the deceased. The collaborations that emerge from posthumous editing of these biographies are sites of significant activity that coalesce into complex but temporary collaborations. Based on these findings, we argue that Wikipedia has re-imagined the obituary into a genre for creating memory spaces in which the death of a subject prompts a form of "death work" involving the collective re-evaluation of article content and a transition into a new mode of data stewardship.},

Next, the privacy policies of a selection of eight social network sites and user generated content sites are analyzed using this set of criteria for informed consent.

The event studied is the ‘first Internet strike’ of 18 January 2012 aimed against the SOPA legislation proposed in the USA. Wikipedia’s volunteer editors from all around the world took part in the vote concerning whether Wikipedia should undertake a protest action aimed at influencing American policymakers. Wikipedia editors are shown to share values of the international free culture movement, though experienced editors were also likely to be conflicted about whether taking part in a protest action was not violating the site’s principle of encyclopedic neutrality. Further, Wikipedia’s participation in this protest action allowed non-US citizens to have a visible impact on the US national legislation. As such, Wikipedia can be seen as an international social movement organization, whose 24 hour-long blackout of its popular website was a major factor in the success of the anti-SOPA protests. Wikipedia’s blackout was an expression of an international political opportunity structure in the form of worldwide awareness and protests, which in turn enabled a national political opportunity structure by informing and mobilizing American citizens.},

  abstract    = {In this work, I discuss the tension between gift and market economy throughout the history of creativity. For millennia, the production of creative artifacts has lain at the intersection between gift and market economy. From the time of Pindar and Simonides – and until the Romanticism will commence a process leading to the complete commodification of creative artifacts – market exchange models run parallel to gift exchange. From Roman amicitia to the medieval and Renaissance belief that “scientia donum dei est, unde vendi non potest,” creativity has been repeatedly construed as a gift. Again, at the time of the British and French “battle of the booksellers,” the rhetoric of the gift still resounded powerfully from the nebula of the past to shape the constitutional moment of copyright law. The return of gift exchange models has a credible source in the history of creativity. Today, after a long unchallenged dominance of the market, gift economy is re-gaining momentum in the digital society. The anthropological and sociological studies of gift exchange, such as Marcel Mauss’ The Gift, served to explain the phenomenon of open source software and hacker communities. Later, communities of social trust, such as Wikipedia, YouTube, and fan-fiction communities, spread virally online through gift exchange models. In peer and user-generated production, community recognition supersedes economic incentives. User-based creativity thrives on the idea of “playful enjoyment,” rather than economic incentives. Anthropologists placed societies on an economic evolutionary scale from gift to commodity exchange, in a continuum from the clan system to the class system and the capitalist system of organization. I suggest that that continuum should now extend to the “crowd society,” which features new modes of social interaction in digital online communities. The networked, open and mass-collaborative character of the crowd society enhances the proliferativeness of the gift exchange model that lies in what anthropologists and social scientists described as a debt-economy. The exploration of the creative mechanics of online communities put under scrutiny the validity of utilitarian theories of copyright and traditional market economy models. From Émile Durkheim and Mauss to Alain Caillé, anti-utilitarian thought designed a new political economy that defines humans as a “cooperative species,” rather than Homo economicus. In this context, I look into commons theory, through the lens of Elinor Ostrom’s work, and its application to modern commons-based peer production with special emphasis on Yochai Benkler and Jerome Reichman’s work. In conclusion, I evoke Jean Baudrillard’s essential question: “Will we return, one day, beyond the market economy, to prodigality?” I consider whether the digital revolution that promoted the emergence of the networked information economy is that “revolution of the social organization and of social relations” that might bring about, according to Baudrillard, “real affluence” through a return to “collective prodigality,” rather than our “productivistic societies, which [. . .] are dominated by scarcity, by the obsession with scarcity characteristic of the market economy.” I argue that a possibility for the reinstatement of Baudrillard’s “collective prodigality” might have materialized in the “crowd society” thanks to technological advancement and the emergence of a consumer gift system or “users’ patronage,” promoting an unrestrained, diffused and networked discourse between creators and the public, through digital crowd-funding.},

  abstract = {The process whereby inferences are made from textual data is broadly referred to as text mining. In order to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the derived inferences, several approaches have been proposed for different text mining applications. Among these applications, classifying a piece of text into pre-defined classes through the utilisation of training data falls into supervised approaches while arranging related documents or terms into clusters falls into unsupervised approaches. In both these approaches, processing is undertaken at the level of documents to make sense of text within those documents. Recent research efforts have begun exploring the role of knowledge bases in solving the various problems that arise in the domain of text mining. Of all the knowledge bases, Wikipedia on account of being one of the largest human-curated, online encyclopaedia has proven to be one of the most valuable resources in dealing with various problems in the domain of text mining. However, previous Wikipedia-based research efforts have not taken both Wikipedia categories and Wikipedia articles together as a source of information. 
 
This thesis serves as a first step in eliminating this gap and throughout the contributions made in this thesis, we have shown the effectiveness of Wikipedia category-article structure for various text mining tasks. Wikipedia categories are organized in a taxonomical manner serving as semantic tags for Wikipedia articles and this provides a strong abstraction and expressive mode of knowledge representation. In this thesis, we explore the effectiveness of this mode of Wikipedia's expression (i.e., the category-article structure) via its application in the domains of text classification, subjectivity analysis (via a notion of ``perspective" in news search), and keyword extraction. 
 
First, we show the effectiveness of exploiting Wikipedia for two classification tasks i.e., 1- classifying the tweets being relevant/irrelevant to an entity or brand, 2- classifying the tweets into different topical dimensions such as tweets related with workplace, innovation, etc. To do so, we define the notion of {\textbackslash}textit\{relatedness\} between the text in tweet and the information embedded within the Wikipedia category-article structure. Then, we present an application in the area of news search by using the same notion of {\textbackslash}textit\{relatedness\} to show more information related to each search result highlighting the amount {\textbackslash}textit\{perspective\} or subjective bias in each returned result towards a certain opinion, topical drift, etc. Finally, we present a keyword extraction strategy using community detection over the Wikipedia categories to discover related keywords arranged in different communities. 
 
The relationship between Wikipedia categories and articles is explored via a textual phrase matching framework whereby the starting point is textual phrases that match Wikipedia articles' titles/redirects. The Wikipedia articles for which a match occurs are then utilised by extraction of their associated categories, and these Wikipedia categories are used to derive various structural measures such as those relating to taxonomical depth and Wikipedia articles they contain. These measures are utilised in our proposed text classification, subjectivity analysis, and keyword extraction framework and the performance is analysed via extensive experimental evaluations. These experimental evaluations undertake comparisons with standard text mining approaches in the literature and our Wikipedia framework based on its category-article structure outperforms the standard text mining techniques.},

  abstract   = {It is hard to ignore the changes that have occurred to history-making in the digital age. Historians in the academy have observed, critiqued and, in some instances, engaged in the different forms of contemporary history that are related to the integration of the internet and related technologies into everyday lives. While digital history takes many forms, this paper examines Wikipedia as a mode of historical expression in the context of a project on the history of the Australian Paralympic Movement. Wikipedia’s key core content policies of verification, no original research, and neutral point of view (NPOV) as well as the collaborative premise that underpins the online encyclopaedia are the focal points of analysis. This analysis demonstrates that Wikipedia challenges historians who have traditionally produced the professionally approved artefacts of monographs and journal articles. In essence, Wikipedia requires historians to produce knowledge as part of a collaborative community of practice and, in the process, abandon popular theories of truth that underpin empirical-analytical history. Even given these challenges, the history of the Australian Paralympic Movement shows that Wikipedia can be important to history-making in the digital age in at least two ways. Wikipedia provides a mode of historical expression that is complementary to the narratives of traditional books, and the online encyclopaedia generates a community which has produced articles that have enhanced knowledge about the history of disability sport.},

  abstract  = {Social media, such as Wikipedia and Twitter, are an increasingly common source of medical information, including for medical students. It is unknown how medical information in social media compares to medical information in medical textbooks. Here we compare Wikipedia articles on heart attacks and palpitations and tweets mentioning heart attacks and palpitations to chapters from Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine and Braunwald's Heart Disease on myocardial infarction and cardiac dysrhythmias. For heart attacks, the chapters from Harrison's had higher Jaccard similarity to Wikipedia than Braunwald's or Twitter. For palpitations, no pair of sources had a higher Jaccard (token) similarity than any other pair. For no source was the Jaccard (token) similarity attributable to semantic similarity. This suggests that technical and popular sources of medical information focus on different aspects of medicine, rather than one describing a simplified version of the other. We hope our work motivates further investigation into the representation of medical knowledge in different media.},

Records of these processes generate time series of events whose inter-event times follow a probability distribution that displays a fat tail. The grounds for such phenomenon are not yet clearly understood. In the present work we use the freely available Wikipedia editing records to unravel some features of this phenomenon. We show that even though the probability to start editing is conditioned by the circadian 24 hour cycle, the conditional probability for the time interval between successive edits at a given time of the day is independent from the latter. We confirm our findings with the activity of posting on the social network Twitter. Our result suggests there is an intrinsic humankind scheduling pattern: after overcoming the encumbrance to start an activity, there is a robust distribution of new related actions, which does not depend on the time of day.},

The online encyclopedia Wikipedia, which presently comprises 7.2 million articles created by 7.04 million distinct editors, provides a consummate example. We examined all 50 million edits made tothe 1.5 million English-language Wikipedia articles and found that the high-quality articles are distinguished by a marked increase in number of edits, number of editors, and intensity of cooperative behavior, as compared to other articles of similar visibility and age. This is significant because in other domains, fruitful cooperation has proven to be difficult to sustain as the size of the collaboration increases. Furthermore, in spite of the vagaries of human behavior, we show that Wikipedia articles accrete edits according to a simple stochastic mechanism in which edits beget edits. Topics of high interest or relevance are thus naturally brought to the forefront of quality.},

The connections afforded to all of those people, in theory, allow for an unprecedented amount of communication and public participation. The goal of this paper is to examine how those potentials match up to actual patterns of participation. By focusing on Wikipedia, the world’s largest and most used repository of user-generated content, we are able to gain important insights into the geographies of voice and participation. This paper shows that the relative democratisation of the Internet has not brought about a concurrent democratisation of voice and participation. Despite the fact that it is widely used around the world, Wikipedia is characterized by highly uneven geographies of participation. The goal of highlighting these inequalities is not to suggest that they are insurmountable. Our regression analysis shows that the availability of broadband is a clear factor in the propensity of people to participate on Wikipedia. However, the relationship is not a linear one. As a country approaches levels of connectivity above about 450,000 broadband Internet connections, the ability of broadband access to positively affect participation keeps increasing. Complicating this issue is the fact that participation from the world’s economic peripheries tends to focus on editing about the world’s cores rather than their own local regions. These results ultimately point to an informational magnetism that is cast by the world’s economic cores; virtuous and vicious cycles that make it difficult to reconfigure networks and hierarchies of knowledge production.},

  abstract  = {This dissertation represents an exploration of the function and failures of critical subsystems in open production communities with Wikipedia as a case study. Specifically, I explore the nature of rejection via Wikipedia's informal, post-hoc quality control system and identify a consistent ownership bias that undermines Wikipedia's ethos of openness. I also quantify an inherent trade-off between the speed and efficiency of quality control in Wikipedia and the motivation of rejected contributors -- especially new editors. I then proceed to show how Wikipedia's shifting focus on quality control and formal process has led to a dramatic decline in the rate of retention of desirable new editors that threatens the long-term viability of the project.In light of these results, I present studies of two experimental software systems intended to explore potential solutions to this steady decrease in participation. First I draw on social learning theory to evaluate the effectiveness of a new mode of peripheral participation through reader-submitted feedback. I experimentally demonstrate effective strategies for increasing the rate of contributions without decreasing quality and argue for efficient moderation support in order to make quality control worth volunteer time spent away from editing the encyclopedia. Next, I describe the design and three month field study of a new intelligent software system intended to both efficiently support socialization practices in Wikipedia and bring visibility to the systemic problems that lead to declining newcomer retention. I show evidence that the system works in both regards: critical newcomer socialization activities are made dramatically more efficient and users of the system reflect openly on the breakdowns in Wikipedia's quality control processes.This work has already had impact within the Wikipedia community and in directing the strategy employed by the Wikimedia Foundation in designing and evaluating new software for Wikipedia editors.},

  abstract = {The success of Wikipedia demonstrates that open collaboration can be an effective model for organizing geographically-distributed volunteers to perform complex, sustained work at a massive scale. However, Wikipedia's history also demonstrates some of the challenges that large, long-term open collaborations face: the core community of Wikipedia editors--the volunteers who contribute most of the encyclopedia's content and ensure that articles are correct and consistent--has been gradually shrinking since 2007, in part because Wikipedia's social climate has become increasingly inhospitable for newcomers, female editors, and editors from other underrepresented demographics. Previous research studies of change over time within other work contexts, such as corporations, suggests that incremental processes such as bureaucratic formalization can make organizations more rule-bound and less adaptable--in effect, less open--as they grow and age. There has been little research on how open collaborations like Wikipedia change over time, and on the impact of those changes on the social dynamics of the collaborating community and the way community members prioritize and perform work. Learning from Wikipedia's successes and failures can help researchers and designers understand how to support open collaborations in other domains--such as Free/Libre Open Source Software, Citizen Science, and Citizen Journalism. In this dissertation, I examine the role of openness, and the potential antecedents and consequences of formalization, within Wikipedia through an analysis of three distinct but interrelated social structures: community-created rules within the Wikipedia policy environment, coordination work and group dynamics within self-organized open teams called WikiProjects, and the socialization mechanisms that Wikipedia editors use to teach new community members how to participate. To inquire further, I have designed a new editor peer support space, the Wikipedia Teahouse, based on the findings from my empirical studies. The Teahouse is a volunteer-driven project that provides a welcoming and engaging environment in which new editors can learn how to be productive members of the Wikipedia community, with the goal of increasing the number and diversity of newcomers who go on to make substantial contributions to Wikipedia.},

  abstract = {In this era of knowledge economy, a variety of virtual communities are proliferating for the purpose of knowledge creation and utilization. Since the voluntary contributions of members are the essential source of knowledge, member turnover can have significant implications on the survival and success of virtual communities. However, there is a dearth of research on the effect of membership turnover and even the method of measurement for membership turnover is left unclear in virtual communities. In a traditional context, membership turnover is calculated as the ratio of the number of departing members to the average number of members for a given time period. In virtual communities, while the influx of newcomers can be clearly measured, the magnitude of departure is elusive since explicit withdrawals are seldom executed. In addition, there doesn't exist a common way to determine the average number of community members who return and contribute intermittently at will. This study initially examines the limitations in applying the concept of traditional turnover to virtual communities, and proposes five membership fluidity measures based on a preliminary analysis of editing behaviors of 2,978 featured articles in English Wikipedia. Subsequently, this work investigates the relationships between three selected membership fluidity measures and group collaboration performance, reflecting a moderating effect dependent on work characteristic. We obtained the following results: First, membership turnover relates to collaboration efficiency in a right-shortened U-shaped manner, with a moderating effect from work characteristic; given the same turnover rate, the promotion likelihood for a more professional task is lower than that for a less professional task, and the likelihood difference diminishes as the turnover rate increases. Second, contribution period relates to collaboration efficiency in a left-shortened U-shaped manner, with a moderating effect from work characteristic; the marginal performance change per unit change of contribution period is greater for a less professional task. Third, the number of new participants per month relates to collaboration efficiency in a left-shortened reversed U-shaped manner, for which the moderating effect from work characteristic appears to be insignificant.},

  abstract  = {We present an open-source toolkit which allows (i) to reconstruct past states of Wikipedia, and (ii) to efficiently access the edit history of Wikipedia articles. Reconstructing past states of Wikipedia is a prerequisite for reproducing previous experimental work based on Wikipedia. Beyond that, the edit history of Wikipedia articles has been shown to be a valuable knowledge source for NLP, but access is severely impeded by the lack of efficient tools for managing the huge amount of provided data. By using a dedicated storage format, our toolkit massively decreases the data volume to less than 2\% of the original size, and at the same time provides an easy-to-use interface to access the revision data. The language-independent design allows to process any language represented in Wikipedia. We expect this work to consolidate NLP research using Wikipedia in general, and to foster research making use of the knowledge encoded in Wikipedia's edit history.},

  abstract   = {This aim of this article is to explore the potential use of Wikipedia page view data for predicting electoral results. Responding to previous critiques of work using socially generated data to predict elections, which have argued that these predictions take place without any understanding of the mechanism which enables them, we first develop a theoretical model which highlights why people might seek information online at election time, and how this activity might relate to overall electoral outcomes, focussing especially on how different types of parties such as new and established parties might generate different information seeking patterns. We test this model on a novel dataset drawn from a variety of countries in the 2009 and 2014 European Parliament elections. We show that while Wikipedia offers little insight into absolute vote outcomes, it offers a good information about changes in both overall turnout at elections and in vote share for particular parties. These results are used to enhance existing theories about the drivers of aggregate patterns in online information seeking.},

Using this example, we model the emergence, persistence and resolution of severe conflicts during collaboration by coupling opinion formation with article editing in a bounded confidence dynamics. The complex social behavior involved in editing articles is implemented as a minimal model with two basic elements; (i) individuals interact directly to share information and convince each other, and (ii) they edit a common medium to establish their own opinions. Opinions of the editors and that represented by the article are characterised by a scalar variable. When the pool of editors is fixed, three regimes can be distinguished: (a) a stable mainstream article opinion is continuously contested by editors with extremist views and there is slow convergence towards consensus, (b) the article oscillates between editors with extremist views, reaching consensus relatively fast at one of the extremes, and (c) the extremist editors are converted very fast to the mainstream opinion and the article has an erratic evolution. When editors are renewed with a certain rate, a dynamical transition occurs between different kinds of edit wars, which qualitatively reflect the dynamics of conflicts as observed in real Wikipedia data.},

This type of disease forecasting is still in its infancy, but as these methods become more developed it will allow for increasingly robust control measures to react to and prevent large disease outbreaks. While weather forecasting has steadily improved over the last half century and become ubiquitous in modern life, there is surprisingly little work on infectious disease forecasting. Although there has been a great deal of work in modeling disease dynamics, these have seldom been used to generate a probabilistic description of expected future dynamics, given current public health data. Moreover, the mechanism to update expected disease outcomes as new data becomes available is just beginning to receive attention from the public health community. Using CDC influenza-like illness reports and digital monitoring sources, such as observations of Wikipedia article access logs, we are now at a point where forecasting for the influenza season can begin to offer useful information for disease monitoring and mitigation.},

One exception is that of the network of norms that sustain the online Wikipedia community. We study the fifteen-year evolution of this network using the interconnected set of pages that establish, describe, and interpret the community’s norms. Despite Wikipedia’s reputation for ad hoc governance, we find that its normative evolution is highly conservative. The earliest users create norms that both dominate the network and persist over time. These core norms govern both content and interpersonal interactions using abstract principles such as neutrality, verifiability, and assume good faith. As the network grows, norm neighborhoods decouple topologically from each other, while increasing in semantic coherence. Taken together, these results suggest that the evolution of Wikipedia’s norm network is akin to bureaucratic systems that predate the information age.},

With this aim, we apply methods of Markov chains and Google matrix for the analysis of the hyperlink networks of 24 Wikipedia language editions, and rank all their articles by PageRank, 2DRank and CheiRank algorithms. Using automatic extraction of people names, we obtain the top 100 historical figures, for each edition and for each algorithm. We investigate their spatial, temporal, and gender distributions in dependence of their cultural origins. Our study demonstrates not only the existence of skewness with local figures, mainly recognized only in their own cultures, but also the existence of global historical figures appearing in a large number of editions. By determining the birth time and place of these persons, we perform an analysis of the evolution of such figures through 35 centuries of human history for each language, thus recovering interactions and entanglement of cultures over time. We also obtain the distributions of historical figures over world countries, highlighting geographical aspects of cross-cultural links. Considering historical figures who appear in multiple editions as interactions between cultures, we construct a network of cultures and identify the most influential cultures according to this network.},

Previous studies have focused either on the advantages of wikis or on concerns over the use of Wikipedia. In this study, we propose to use Wikipedia as a classroom wiki. In doing so, we discuss how students can improve their standard written assignments using Wikipedia instead of a module wiki. Compared to traditional essay assignments, students’ submission of articles to Wikipedia can address many of the problems faced by instructors of traditional assignments, such as students’ poor writing skills, lack of primary source research, and poorly balanced discussions. Our study was based on our experience in teaching an upper-level economics module at the National University of Singapore over two semesters: 121 students who were enrolled in semester 1 submitted a traditional writing assignment, while 124 students enrolled in semester 2 contributed two short entries to Wikipedia. The results showed a large increase in the number of students checking their assignment feedback. Further, students’ writing quality improved noticeably in the Wikipedia assignment, and they were able to put forth more balanced discussions of relevant issues and include a greater number of primary sources. Despite the challenges faced when using Wiki markup language, the students enjoyed the overall experience.},

However, extracting knowledge from unstructured sources is still an open challenge. In this respect, understanding the structure of knowledge bases can provide significant benefits for the effectiveness of such purpose. In particular, Wikipedia has become a very popular knowledge base in the last years because it is a general encyclopedia that has a large amount of information and thus, covers a large amount of different topics. In this piece of work, we analyze how articles and categories of Wikipedia relate to each other and how these relationships can support a query expansion technique.

Thus, the structural dimension of knowledge is related to its dynamics.

To evaluate the accuracy of this resource, the authors compared Wikipedia articles on the most costly medical conditions with standard, evidence-based, peer-reviewed sources.
Methods: The top 10 most costly conditions in terms of public and private expenditure in the United States were identified, and a Wikipedia article corresponding to each topic was chosen. In a blinded process, 2 randomly assigned investigators independently reviewed each article and identified all assertions (ie, implication or statement of fact) made in it. The reviewer then conducted a literature search to determine whether each assertion was supported by evidence. The assertions found by each reviewer were compared and analyzed to determine whether assertions made by Wikipedia for these conditions were supported by peer-reviewed sources.
Results: For commonly identified assertions, there was statistically significant discordance between 9 of the 10 selected Wikipedia articles (coronary artery disease, lung cancer, major depressive disorder, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, back pain, and hyperlipidemia) and their corresponding peer-reviewed sources (P{\textless}.05) and for all assertions made by Wikipedia for these medical conditions (P{\textless}.05 for all 9).
Conclusion: Most Wikipedia articles representing the 10 most costly medical conditions in the United States contain many errors when checked against standard peer-reviewed sources. Caution should be used when using Wikipedia to answer questions regarding patient care.},

The emergent patterns of collective attention determine what new information is generated and consumed. Can we measure the relationship between demand and supply for new information about a topic? Here we propose a normalization method to compare attention bursts statistics across topics that have an heterogeneous distribution of attention. Through analysis of a massive dataset on traffic to Wikipedia, we find that the production of new knowledge is associated to significant shifts of collective attention, which we take as a proxy for its demand. What we observe is consistent with a scenario in which the allocation of attention toward a topic stimulates the demand for information about it, and in turn the supply of further novel information. Our attempt to quantify demand and supply of information, and our finding about their temporal ordering, may lead to the development of the fundamental laws of the attention economy, and a better understanding of the social exchange of knowledge in online and offline information networks.},

  abstract   = {Despite the fact that Wikipedia articles about current events are more popular and attract more contributions than typical articles, canonical studies of Wikipedia have only analyzed articles about pre-existing information. We expect the co-authoring of articles about breaking news incidents to exhibit high-tempo coordination dynamics which are not found in articles about historical events and information. Using 1.03 million revisions made by 158,384 users to 3,233 English Wikipedia articles about disasters, catastrophes, and conflicts since 1990, we construct "article trajectories" of editor interactions as they coauthor an article. Examining a subset of this corpus, our analysis demonstrates that articles about current events exhibit structures and dynamics distinct from those observed among articles about non-breaking events. These findings have implications for how collective intelligence systems can be leveraged to process and make sense of complex information.},

We investigate the feasibility of applying link-based methods in new applications domains. The specific application we consider is to partition authors into opposite camps within a given topic in the context of newsgroups. A typical newsgroup posting consists of one or more quoted lines from another posting followed by the opinion of the author. This social behavior gives rise to a network in which the vertices are individuals and the links represent "responded-to" relationships. An interesting characteristic of many newsgroups is that people more frequently respond to a message when they disagree than when they agree. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the WWW link graph, where linkage is an indicator of agreement or common interest. By analyzing the graph structure of the responses, we are able to effectively classify people into opposite camps. In contrast, methods based on statistical analysis of text yield low accuracy on such datasets because the vocabulary used by the two sides tends to be largely identical, and many newsgroup postings consist of relatively few words of text.},

  abstract  = {An increasingly common feature of online communities and social media sites is a mechanism for rewarding user achievements based on a system of badges. Badges are given to users for particular contributions to a site, such as performing a certain number of actions of a given type. They have been employed in many domains, including news sites like the Huffington Post, educational sites like Khan Academy, and knowledge-creation sites like Wikipedia and Stack Overflow. At the most basic level, badges serve as a summary of a user's key accomplishments; however, experience with these sites also shows that users will put in non-trivial amounts of work to achieve particular badges, and as such, badges can act as powerful incentives. Thus far, however, the incentive structures created by badges have not been well understood, making it difficult to deploy badges with an eye toward the incentives they are likely to create.

In this paper, we study how badges can influence and steer user behavior on a site---leading both to increased participation and to changes in the mix of activities a user pursues on the site. We introduce a formal model for reasoning about user behavior in the presence of badges, and in particular for analyzing the ways in which badges can steer users to change their behavior. To evaluate the main predictions of our model, we study the use of badges and their effects on the widely used Stack Overflow question-answering site, and find evidence that their badges steer behavior in ways closely consistent with the predictions of our model. Finally, we investigate the problem of how to optimally place badges in order to induce particular user behaviors. Several robust design principles emerge from our framework that could potentially aid in the design of incentives for a broad range of sites.},

A number of studies find that, like in other collective goods, incentives for reputation and group identity motivate contributions to open source goods, thereby overcoming the social dilemma inherent in producing such goods. In this paper we examine how contributor motivations affect the quality of contributions to the open-content online encyclopedia Wikipedia. We find that quality is associated with contributor motivations, but in a surprisingly inconsistent way. Registered users' quality increases with more contributions, consistent with the idea of participants motivated by reputation and commitment to the Wikipedia community. Surprisingly, however, we find the highest quality from the vast numbers of anonymous "Good Samaritans" who contribute only once. Our findings that Good Samaritans as well as committed "zealots" contribute high quality content to Wikipedia suggest that it is the quantity as well as the quality of contributors that positively affects the quality of open source production.},

Furthermore, we illustrate how readers provide a valuable service to Wikipedia. Finally, we use the notion of legitimate peripheral participation to argue that reading is a gateway activity through which newcomers learn about Wikipedia. We find support for our arguments in the results of a survey of Wikipedia usage and knowledge. Implications for future research and design are discussed.},

Preliminary evidence suggests that wiki is a sustainable collaboration tool and that wikis deployment is experiencing massive success. The objective of this paper is to provide a large scale evaluation of corporate wikis life cycles. We analyze and categorize the temporal activity patterns of more than thirteen thousand wikis in one multinational organization over a 29 months period. This clustering problem poses some unique challenges, and required the development of novel extensions to existing algorithms. We identified four clusters and their prototypical activity patterns. Our findings show that, contrary to what has been suggested in previous studies, most corporate wikis become inactive after a relatively short period, and less than 20% of wikis show continuous activity. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Wikipedia's success is often attributed to the large numbers of contributors who improve the accuracy, completeness and clarity of articles while reducing bias. However, because of the coordination needed to write an article collaboratively, adding contributors is costly. We examined how the number of editors in Wikipedia and the coordination methods they use affect article quality. We distinguish between explicit coordination, in which editors plan the article through communication, and implicit coordination, in which a subset of editors structure the work by doing the majority of it. Adding more editors to an article improved article quality only when they used appropriate coordination techniques and was harmful when they did not. Implicit coordination through concentrating the work was more helpful when many editors contributed, but explicit coordination through communication was not. Both types of coordination improved quality more when an article was in a formative stage. These results demonstrate the critical importance of coordination in effectively harnessing the "wisdom of the crowd" in online production environments.},

Though everyone can participate it is well known that the editor community has a narrow diversity, with a majority of white male editors. While this participatory {\textbackslash}emph\{gender gap\} has been studied extensively in the literature, this work sets out to {\textbackslash}emph\{assess potential gender inequalities in Wikipedia articles\} along different dimensions: notability, topical focus, linguistic bias, structural properties and meta-data presentation. We find that (i) women in Wikipedia are more notable than men which we interpret as the outcome of a subtle glass ceiling effect; (ii) family-, gender- and relationship-related topics are more present in biographies about women; (iii) linguistic biases manifest in Wikipedia since abstract terms tend to be used to describe positive aspects in the biographies of men and negative aspects in the biographies of women; and (iv) there are structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities. While some differences are expected, due to historical and social contexts, other differences are attributable to Wikipedia editors. The implications of such differences are discussed, specially having Wikipedia contribution policies in mind. We hope that our work contributes to increase awareness about, first, gender issues in the content of Wikipedia, and second, the different levels on which gender biases can manifest on the Web.},

Engagingly written, and balancing technical detail with intuitive explanations, Complex Adaptive Systems focuses on the key tools and ideas that have emerged in the field since the mid-1990s, as well as the techniques needed to investigate such systems. It provides a detailed introduction to concepts such as emergence, self-organized criticality, automata, networks, diversity, adaptation, and feedback. It also demonstrates how complex adaptive systems can be explored using methods ranging from mathematics to computational models of adaptive agents.    John Miller and Scott Page show how to combine ideas from economics, political science, biology, physics, and computer science to illuminate topics in organization, adaptation, decentralization, and robustness. They also demonstrate how the usual extremes used in modeling can be fruitfully transcended.},

  abstract  = {After its introduction in the 1950s, the semantic differential ({SD}) received enormous attention among psychologists and other social and behavioral scientists. Especially during the 1960s, its methodological details and possible fields of application were broadly and critically discussed. In 1969, David R.J. Heise reports more than 1000 papers on {SD} – a huge amount given the publication rates of that time. A good deal of this attention might be due to its promise to ‘repair’ a vital defect of behaviorist thinking, its smart use of factor analysis (a fashionable method at that time), and its connectivity to prominent debates on meaning in linguistics and philosophy of language. Especially Charles E. Osgood's claim for a universal structure of meaning in the {EPA} (evaluation, potency, and activity) structure points to the heart of the debate on semantic relativism.

In the early 1970s, behaviorism lost its position as the leading paradigm of psychology whereas cognitivism gained increased attention. The interest in the {SD} decreased. Still, {SD} joined the group of standard scaling techniques during the 1980s and 1990s. Today, it is applied by many disciplines worldwide, such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, marketing research, etc.},

When normal individuals were transferred from a conventional 16-h photoperiod to an experimental 10-h photo-period, their sleep episodes expanded and usually divided into two symmetrical bouts, several hours in duration, with a 1–3 h waking interval between them. The durations of nocturnal melatonin secretion and of the nocturnal phase of rising sleepiness (measured in a constant routine protocol) also expanded, indicating that the timing of internal processes that control sleep and melatonin, such as circadian rhythms, had been modified by the change in photoperiod. Previous work suggests that the experimental results could be simulated with dual-oscillators, entrained separately to dawn and dusk, or with a two-process model, having a lowered threshold for sleep-onset during the scotoperiod.},

Russel and his husband-to-be have invited all their close friends to spend the whole weekend together beforehand.And for the first time in his life, Russel is determined to not be neurotic, and not over-think things.But that's before things start going wrong. Who expected a dead killer whale to wash up on the beach below the inn? And what's this about a windstorm approaching? Then there's the problem of Russel's anxious fiancé, who is increasingly convinced the whole thing is going to be a disaster.Meanwhile, the wedding is taking place near the ruins of a small town, Amazing, where, a hundred years earlier, the people supposedly all disappeared overnight. Why does it feel like the secret at the end of the road to Amazing has something to do with Russel's own future?Can Russel's friends Min, Gunnar, Vernie, and Otto somehow help him make it all make sense?The Road to Amazing, the final book in the Russel Middlebrook Futon Years trilogy, is a story about endings and beginnings, and also about growing up and growing older.

  abstract  = {Both online and off, people frequently perform particular social roles. These roles organize behavior and give structure to positions in local networks. As more of social life becomes embedded in online systems, the concept of social role becomes increasingly valuable as a tool for simplifying patterns of action, recognizing distinct user types, and cultivating and managing communities. This paper standardizes the usage of the term 'social role' in online community as a combination of social psychological, social structural, and behavioral attributes. Beyond the conceptual definition, we describe measurement and analysis strategies for identifying social roles in online community. We demonstrate this process in two domains, Usenet and Wikipedia, identifying key social roles in each domain. We conclude with directions for future research, with a particular focus on the analysis of communities as role ecologies.},

Yet, while E. coli, strep, and other bacterial pathogens certainly cause their share of misery in the world, they are only a tiny portion of a vast universe of microorganisms—the most basic of life forms. Without them, nothing else could live or grow on Planet Earth. Bacteria: The Benign, the Bad, and the Beautiful introduces you to this diverse, microscopic world and explains the fundamental microbiological concepts you need to explore the life and behavior of bacteria. Even if you have no previous background in the subject, the book's clear, jargon-free language tells you what you need to know about: The origins and evolution of bacteria Some of the fundamental ways in which bacteria have shaped the world Bacteria commonly found in the healthy human body Antibiotics and the growing problem of resistance Marine microbiology, bacterial toxins, and enzymes Bacterial genetics and genomics Bacteria that survive in extreme environments, such as boiling water And much more This comprehensive guide features custom-drawn, black-and-white illustrations by artist Karoly Farkas, and it illuminates its points through real-world examples and engaging stories. Discrete, topic-by-topic structure, text-box summaries of background science, and a helpful glossary make for quick and easy reference. Whether you are a science professional in need of information on bacteria outside of your specialty, a student in search of a solid introduction, or a curious reader looking for fascinating and reliable information, Bacteria: The Benign, the Bad, and the Beautiful is the resource you need.},

Fighters and tanks idling on the runway with no drivers. This is bad juju. Something wrong happened here. What you should do is tell everyone to leave."The gates have opened the way to a thousand new worlds and the rush to colonize has begun. Settlers looking for a new life stream out from humanity's home planets. Ilus, the first human colony on this vast new frontier, is being born in blood and fire. Independent settlers stand against the overwhelming power of a corporate colony ship with only their determination, courage, and the skills learned in the long wars of home.

  abstract  = {This paper investigates some of the social roles people play in the online community of Wikipedia. We start from qualitative comments posted on community oriented pages, wiki project memberships, and user talk pages in order to identify a sample of editors who represent four key roles: substantive experts, technical editors, vandal fighters, and social networkers. Patterns in edit histories and egocentric network visualizations suggest potential "structural signatures" that could be used as quantitative indicators of role adoption. Using simple metrics based on edit histories we compare two samples of Wikipedians: a collection of long term dedicated editors, and a cohort of editors from a one month window of new arrivals. According to these metrics, we find that the proportions of editor types in the new cohort are similar those observed in the sample of dedicated contributors. The number of new editors playing helpful roles in a single month's cohort nearly equal the number found in the dedicated sample. This suggests that informal socialization has the potential provide sufficient role related labor despite growth and change in Wikipedia. These results are preliminary, and we describe several ways that the method can be improved, including the expansion and refinement of role signatures and identification of other important social roles.},

Yet Wikipedia over the years has become a complicated bureaucracy that may be difficult for newcomers to navigate. Mentoring is a practice that has been widely used in offline organizations to help new members adjust to their roles. In this paper, we draw insights from the offline mentoring literature to analyze mentoring practices in Wikipedia and how they influence editor behaviors. Our quantitative analysis of the Adopt-a-user program shows mixed success of the program. Communication between adopters and adoptees is correlated with the amount of article editing done by adoptees shortly after adoption. Our qualitative analysis of the communication between adopters and adoptees suggests that several key functions of mentoring are missing or not fulfilled consistently. Most adopters focus on establishing their legitimacy rather than acting proactively to guide, protect, and support the long-term growth of adoptees. We conclude with recommendations of how Wikipedia mentoring programs can evolve to take advantage of offline best practices.},

  abstract   = {In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, Limits to Growth—the first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet— Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.},

  abstract  = {60+ years of planning for a human mission to Mars are documented, based on Portree’s superb history. Starting with von Braun’s vision of the 1950s, many attempts were made to define a feasible human mission to Mars. Development of nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) began in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1968, Boeing published a detailed design of a human mission to Mars making extensive use of NTP. The Boeing 1968 study set a high bar for extraordinary detail in analysis of the many subsystems and components needed for a human mission to Mars. It is unfortunate that many subsequent studies failed to come close to clearing that bar. Mission concepts continued to appear through the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, NASA produced Design Reference Missions DRM-1 and DRM-3 that became standard bearers for Mars planning. These DRMs introduced important use of ISRU, and continued to rely on NTP. In the same time frame, Zubrin developed the Mars Direct concept and Caltech developed the Mars Society Mission concept. In 2005, NASA published a summary of an extensive mission study known as DRA-5, but backup for this summary does not seem to be available. In 2014, NASA announced the Evolvable Mars Campaign. It seems likely that the EMC is just another NASA boondoggle using vague and ephemeral notions based on glossy viewgraphs, and a total lack of detailed engineering calculations. It will end up being scrapped for good reasons, as NASA moves on to its next long-range plan. After 60+ years of planning, we still don’t have a plan.},

  abstract  = {Estimating the size of a large and complex software system is a challenging task. Early in a project’s life cycle, when requirements for the system may be immature and functionality defined only at a high level, resource profiles are necessary for appropriate funding, staffing, and development of a viable project plan. Similar project historical software size data and trends provide a tool to predict software size, creating a feasible estimation approach. To confidently estimate the flight software required for the Orion Spacecraft, NASA conducted an analysis of similar space and aircraft software systems. This paper presents the results of a study that compiled data from over 400 spacecraft, aircraft, and submarine software projects, which were functionally similar in nature to the Orion spacecraft flight software. The study includes the analysis and summary of overall trends in software size, development strategies, and processes. The results indicate a well-correlated upward trend in software size over time for both crewed and uncrewed space and aircraft. This trend was used to predict the estimated completed size of the Orion flight software at approximately 2.3 million Source Lines of Code (SLOC).},

In this paper, we present a framework of metrics for the quality and maturity of categorization standards, and apply these metrics to eClass, UNSPSC, eOTD, and RNTD. The results clearly show weaknesses which hamper the use in many application domains. Also, we can reveal that only some of these standards are actually maintained and updated, while others are rather inactive, dead collections. 1.},

  abstract  = {Air quality in the small, closed environment of a spacecraft cabin is always a critical
  matter for the safety, health, and comfort of the crew. The technologies used to keep air breathable
  in spacecraft have a unique set of requirements because of several constraints that become more
  important as the duration and distance of space missions lengthen. Technologies must be extremely
  robust, as supplies and spare parts are few and resupply may be impossible. They must be well coordinated
  and function in a tightly integrated life-support system. Mass, volume, and power consumption
  must be minimal due to the high cost of launch mass and limited solar/battery energy. This article
  examines some of the issues associated with spacecraft air revitalization and briefly reviews some
  of the technologies developed to maintain quality and minimize waste through recycling of air. We
  emphasize approaches for long-duration missions (i.e., more than one month), in which technologies
  need to be regenerable and the oxygen cycle needs to approach closure. We also discuss air revitalization
  systems for the International Space Station and needs for long-distance missions such as Mars transit.

Although these components have performed admirably for short-duration subsystem tests, there is little long-range operational (life test) data available. It is important to know not only how long a subsystem is anticipated to perform, but also the problems that can be expected should subsystem components fail. For this reason, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) developed the ECLSS Life Test program. To date, assemblies and subassemblies that are being or have been tested include the Trace Contaminant Control Subassembly (TCCS), the Vapor Compression Distillation Urine Processor Assembly (VCD-UPA), the Four-Bed Molecular Sieve Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (4BMS-CDRA), and the Solid Polymer Electrolyzer Oxygen Generation Assembly (SPE-OGA). Also included in life testing are noncomponent life test studies. These include the Water Degradation Study and the Biofilm Life Test. The Water Degradation Study looks at water quality changes after exposure to simulated ISS pre-Water Recovery Management (WRM) conditions. The Biofilm Life Test will examine microbial accumulation on surfaces in a simulated ISS water delivery system. This article will briefly review the objectives of each life test program, the results of completed tests, and the major problems observed during the tests.},

Development of CELSS technology is inevitable for future long duration stays of human beings in space, for lunar base construction and for manned mars flight programs. CELSS functions can be divided into two categories, Environment Control and Material Recycling. Temperature, humidity, total atmospheric pressure and partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide, necessary for all living things, are to be controlled by the environment control function. This function can be performed by technologies already developed and used as the Environment Control Life Support System (ECLSS) of Space Shuttle and Space Station. As for material recycling, matured technologies have not yet been established for fully satisfying the specific metabolic requirements of each living thing including human beings. Therefore, research activities for establishing CELSS technology should be focused on material recycling technologies using biological systems such as plants and animals and physico-chemical systems, for example, a gas recycling system, a water purifying and recycling system and a waste management system. Based on these considerations, Japanese research activities have been conducted and will be continued under the tentative guideline of CELSS research activities as shown in documents /1/, /2/.

Not only did the flight win the X-Prize and a cool US$10 million, it was also a milestone in the commercial development of space because the feat was achieved without accepting any government dollars. It was an accomplishment that Mr. Bigelow (who was among those watching the flight) could relate to because, just a few years before SS1’s epic flight, Bigelow had announced his intention to get into the commercial space race. That was in 1998 when the concept of commercial spaceflight was alien to just about everybody, so very few paid attention, and even fewer gave him a chance. But, less than two years after the X-Prize winning flight, Bigelow’s first creation was orbiting Earth, thereby ensuring that the development of space will never be the same.},

  abstract  = {Bacteria were the first life forms to appear on Earth, and they have a long history of association with mineral surfaces. Surfaces of clay minerals played an important role in the initial evolutionary processes of bacteria and the diversification of their physiology (Kluyver and van Niel 1956; Mayr 1998; Wächtershäuser 1988; Woese 1987, 1990, 1998; Woese and Olsen 1986). Bacteria also adapt themselves to a mode of living on physical surfaces and at interfaces (Angles et al. 1993; Bitton 1980; Brune et al. 2000; Caldwell et al. 1997; Fenchel and Finlay 1995; Fletcher 1980; Glagolev 1984; Hugenholtz et al. 1998; Margulis 1981; Marshall 1992; Moat and Foster 1988; Pace 1997; Wolfaardt et al. 1994; Zavarzin et al. 1994; Zinder 1993). In addition, they are capable of degrading a wide range of pollutants (Gibson 1984; Gu and Berry 1991, 1992; Gu et al. 1992a; Young and Cerniglia 1995). It is well recognized that degradation of organic chemicals and nutrient cycling are more rapid on surfaces. Unfortunately, microbial association with surfaces also has a potential negative economic impact, when it accelerates degradation and deterioration of a wide range of materials, including inorganic minerals (Gu et al. 2000b; Mitchell and Gu 2000), concrete, and stone (Gebers and Hirsch 1978; Gu et al. 2000b; Moosavi et al. 1986; Padival et al. 1995; Piervittori et al. 1994; Prieto et al. 1995); metals (Ford and Mitchell 1990b; Gu et al. 2000a; Miller 1970); and natural and synthetic polymers (Gu et al. 2000d; Guezennec et al. 1998; Swift et al. 1979). In all cases, the essential ingredient is the close association between the microflora and the material surface.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a methodology to derive architectures and operational concepts for future earth-to-orbit and sub-orbital transportation systems. In particular, at first, it describes the activity flow, methods, and tools leading to the generation of a wide range of alternative solutions to meet the established goal. Subsequently, the methodology allows selecting a small number of feasible options among which the optimal solution can be found. For the sake of clarity, the first part of the paper describes the methodology from a theoretical point of view, while the second part proposes the selection of mission concepts and of a proper transportation system aimed at sub-orbital parabolic flights. Starting from a detailed analysis of the stakeholders and their needs, the major objectives of the mission have been derived. Then, following a system engineering approach, functional analysis tools as well as concept of operations techniques allowed generating a very high number of possible ways to accomplish the envisaged goals. After a preliminary pruning activity, aimed at defining the feasibility of these concepts, more detailed analyses have been carried out. Going on through the procedure, the designer should move from qualitative to quantitative evaluations, and for this reason, to support the trade-off analysis, an ad-hoc built-in mission simulation software has been exploited. This support tool aims at estimating major mission drivers (mass, heat loads, manoeuverability, earth visibility, and volumetric efficiency) as well as proving the feasibility of the concepts. Other crucial and multi-domain mission drivers, such as complexity, innovation level, and safety have been evaluated through the other appropriate analyses. Eventually, one single mission concept has been selected and detailed in terms of layout, systems, and sub-systems, highlighting also logistic, safety, and maintainability aspects.},

  abstract  = {A number of critical technologies are needed for a human mission to Mars that require considerable further development. These include life support: environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS), mitigation of radiation and low gravity effects, providing abort options, potential utilization of indigenous planetary resources, and human factors associated with long durations in confined space. While significant progress was made on ECLSS prior to 2005, there is little indication of progress in the past decade. NASA has made progress in understanding radiation effects but as more information accrues, the problem appears worse. Work on artificial gravity seems moribund. Use of simulated habitats in remote areas on Earth is helping to gradually understand issues associated with confined space. A vital need for a human mission to Mars is aero-assisted entry, descent and landing (EDL) of massive payloads. There is no experience base for landing payloads with mass of multi-tens of mT. Modeling by the Georgia Tech team indicates that the mass of EDL systems will be considerably greater than that assumed by NASA Design Reference Missions. Nevertheless, aero assisted EDL requires far less mass than EDL based on propulsion, and use of propulsion for EDL is probably unaffordable. Developing, testing and validating such massive entry systems will require a two-decade program with a significant investment. Based on past performance, NASA does not appear to have the discipline to follow through on such a program.},

In fixed bed reactors, this catalyst proved capable of the continuous long-term deep oxidation of a variety of aqueous organic contaminants associated with spacecraft wastewater streams at 121 °C. This work was extended to the mineralization of more typical environmental contaminants, including halocarbons and aromatics. The primary weakness of this catalyst was the tendency toward relatively high rates of chemical decomposition. To overcome this limitation, methods were developed for the production of a silicon carbide coating over the surface of the activated carbon, yielding a reasonable trade-off between increasing resilience and decreasing surface area. Here we report the catalytic decomposition of dissolved organic contaminants at 130 °C using this silicon carbide/activated carbon supported bimetallic catalyst.},

  abstract  = {Manmade ecosystems differ from their prototype biosphere by the principle of control. The Earth Biosphere is sustainable by stochastic control and very large time constants. By contrast, in a closed ecosystem such as the micro-ecological life support system alternative (MELiSSA system) developed by the European Space Agency for space exploration, a deterministic control is a prerequisite of sustainable existence. MELiSSA is an integrated sum of interconnected biological subsystems. On one hand, all unit operations in charge of the elementary functions constitutive of the entire life support system are studied until a thorough understanding and mathematical modelling. On the other hand, the systemic approach of complex, highly branched systems with feedback loops is performed. This leads to study in the same perspective, with the same degree of accuracy and with the same language, waste degradation, water recycling, atmosphere revitalisation and food production systems prior to the integration of knowledge-based control models. This paper presents the mathematical modelling of the MELiSSA system and the interface between the control strategy of the entire system and the control of the bioreactors.},

  abstract  = {A pilot plant has been built for the regeneration of humidity condensates during shuttle missions. The plant is an automated experimental apparatus which includes an electrochemical cell, two reservoirs and a control system to maintain the temperature within a chosen range, so that the ionic exchange membranes are not damaged. The electrodes used to determine catalytic efficiency were: platinised titanium with ruthenium oxide and Sb and Sn coatings deposited on a Ti substrate, prepared with two different techniques, spray/brush coating and electro-deposition. The Ti/SnO2–Sb2O5 coating was characterized through the following techniques: X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) and linear and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Among the different contaminant dissolved in the contaminant solution, urea was chosen to carry out the electrochemical tests. Several regenerative treatment runs were performed with the solution simulating the shuttle condensate water to determine the evolution, during the tests, of the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, the nitrate and nitrite concentrations, the ammonia concentration, the pH and the conductivity. These runs were carried out at different current intensities to understand the influence of the anodic current on the organic decomposition rates, in particular of the urea in presence of an amount of sodium chloride. The contaminant removal efficiencies in the electro-oxidation test appeared to be depressed for both electrodes at high current density, whereas the inversion of the electrode polarity seemed to offer a further advantage. The best result reached in the direct electro-oxidation was the 24 ppm as TOC with Ti/SnO2–Sb2O5 at 0.2 A. This value is far from the limit concentration (0.5 ppm), which is the standard level for drinking water in space appliances. During the tests, a decrease in the pH was observed, due to the formation of refractory substances such as organic acids.},

Installed within the apparatus are scaled-down versions of a subset of flight-equivalent atmospheric reconditioning subassemblies together with sensors, actuators and a computer to perform autonomous feedback-driven supervisory control. We present data that validates an integrated closed-loop system which includes oxygen replenishment, carbon dioxide scrubbing via reaction with lithium hydroxide, ammonia removal using acid-treated activated charcoal, and humidity control with a custom-designed condensing heat exchanger. An atmospheric monitoring suite incorporates commercially available off-the-shelf low-mass, low-power sensors to perform continuous environmental monitoring. The entire system is enclosed within a zero pressure gradient barrier membrane with sealed ports for power, data and contingency air sampling. Results of a 25-day experiment represent a proof-of-concept for certain key elements of the Mars Gravity Biosatellite&#039;s ECLSS strategy.

Not a bad accomplishment for a company that had been founded only seven years previously. But, while Bigelow Aerospace was founded in 1999, it wasn’t until 2004 that the company’s high-stakes business plan to develop commercial habitats became widely known. With public attention focused on the International Space Station (ISS), Bigelow quietly went about his business developing a mini-Skunk Works for NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC). At the time, it was hoped that with technical assistance from JSC, Bigelow would be ready to launch his inflatable modules by the end of the decade. But, realizing there was no affordable way of launching his clients to their modules on orbit, Bigelow was spurred to create the US$50 million space launch competition called America’s Space Prize in 2004. The goal of the prize was to drive development of affordable manned launch vehicles capable of ferrying up to seven astronauts to low Earth orbit (LEO), and do it by the end of the decade. The winner, apart from winning US$50 million, would be guaranteed first rights on a contract from Bigelow for orbital servicing missions to the company’s Nautilus modules (later renamed the BA-330). It was anticipated the Nautilus would be launched on a Proton-class booster and be ready for launch sometime in 2008},

  abstract  = {Upon arriving above 2,500 m, the organism compensates the diminished inspired oxygen partial pressure by increasing ventilation and cardiac output. The pneumodynamic pump moves more rarefied air into the alveoli through an increase of the respiratory frequency and the tidal volume. Likewise, the hemodynamic pump increases both the cardiac frequency and the stroke volume, as if exercise were performed at sea level. The two pumps, one for air and the other for blood, carry out the essential role of supplying sufficient oxygen to the tissues and increasing the energy consumption until the red blood cells take over. The acid–base status, adequately interpreted at high altitude through the titratable hydrogen ion difference, along with the adaptation formula and multiple cellular changes, gives rise to adaptation. The tolerance to hypoxia formula reflects and explains the paradoxical concept that resistance to hypoxia grows as one goes higher. The possibility that man can adapt to live in the hypoxic environment of the summit of Mt. Everest is exposed. Furthermore, the knowledge of life at high altitude is proposed as an alternative to the environment of space travel. Herein, we describe our 43 years of experience and discoveries with fundamental concepts that change the way disease is treated in the hypoxic environment of high altitude.},

  abstract  = {Planning for a human mission to Mars dates back to the 1950s, but in the 1990s, a new aspect was introduced: In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). In its simplest form, it utilizes indigenous Mars resources to produce propellants for ascent from Mars, thus significantly reducing the mass that must be transported to Mars. If accessible water can be found at a suitable landing site, or if hydrogen can be efficiently transported to Mars, not only ascent propellants, but also water and oxygen for life support could be produced on Mars. In the absence of accessible hydrogen, CO2 in the Mars atmosphere can be electrolyzed to produce oxygen, representing about 78 % of the required total mass of ascent propellants. While lunar ISRU has been claimed by some to be a steppingstone to Mars ISRU, we show here that there is relatively little connection. Furthermore, lunar ISRU has far less mission benefit, and does not appear to provide any return on investment. After years of investing in lunar ISRU, which has not led to much more than impractical concepts, and decades of providing very little funding for Mars ISRU, NASA finally provided significant funding for Mars ISRU in 2014. NASA chose to fund a flight demonstration for the 2020 Mars lander of technologies that were quite immature. Had NASA funded a laboratory program to maturate the needed technologies prior to flight hardware development, the whole process would have been far more effective, and less stressful.},

In this method, the condition monitoring data are first classified by exploiting the comprehensive evaluation technique, and then the feature data are used to train the corresponding diagnosis models, which themselves represent the different stages of system degradation. Due to the variant behavior of the ECLSS in the space environment, variational approximation-based learning is designed in the diagnostics procedure to estimate the parameter distribution of the trained models rather than the parameters themselves. By exploiting the constructed trained models, the current ECLSS health stage and remaining useful life (RUL) can be identified.

Lunar dust is formed from micrometeorite impacts onto the Moon’s surface. The hypervelocity impacts result in communition and the formation of sharp and clingy agglutinates. The dust particles vary in size with the smallest being less than 10 μm. If the chemical reactive particles are deposited in the lungs, they may cause respiratory disease. During lunar exploration, the astronaut’s spacesuits will become contaminated with lunar dust. The dust will be released into the atmosphere when the suits are removed. The exposure risks to health will need to be assessed by relating to a permissible exposure limit. During the Apollo missions, the astronauts were exposed to lunar dust. Acute health effects from dust inhalation exposure included sore throat, sneezing and coughing. Long-term exposure to the dust may cause a more serious respiratory disease similar to silicosis. On future missions the methods used to mitigate exposure will include providing high air recirculation rates in the airlock, the use of a “Double Shell Spacesuit” so that contaminated spacesuits are removed before entering the airlock, the use of dust shields to prevent dust accumulating on surfaces, the use of high gradient magnetic separation to remove surface dust and the use of solar flux to sinter and melt the regolith around the spacecraft.},

Additionally, this water has been stored and used for relatively short periods. To achieve the United States' commitment to a permanent manned presence in space, more innovative techniques are demanded. Over 20,000 pounds of water and large quantities of air would have to be transported to the International Space Station (ISS) every 90 days with a corresponding amount of waste returned to earth, for an eight-person crew. This approach results in prohibitive logistics costs, and necessitates near complete recovery and recycling of water. The potential hazards associated with long-term reuse of reclaimed water and revitalized air resulted in the recognition that additional characterization of closed-loop systems and products is essential. Integrated physical/chemical systems have been designed, assembled, and operated to provide air and potable water meeting ISS quality specifications. The purpose of the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) test program at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is to conduct testing related to the performance of the ISS and its Environmental Control components. The ECLSS Test Program encompasses the Water Recovery Test (WRT), the Integrated Air Revitalization Test (IART), and Life Testing, which permits ECLSS design evaluation. These subsystems revitalize air and reclaim waste waters representative of those to be generated on-orbit. This article provides an overview of MSFC's ECLSS testing. Specific tests include: the Stage 10 Water Recovery Test; the Contaminant Injection Test; the Four-Bed Molecular Sieve Performance Enhancement Test; and Life Testing.},

There are thousands of flight rules for ISS, all documented in Microsoft Word. Monitoring of flight rules is currently done manually by flight controllers who are highly trained in understanding and interpreting flight rules. In this paper we describe a system that allows flight rules to be expressed in a computer-understandable language and that then generates an automated monitoring system that connects to the ISS telemetry stream. For testing purposes we represented and monitored Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) flight rules for ISS smoke detectors. We describe how this flight rule is represented in an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format that captures relationships between different pieces of raw telemetry. We describe a drag-and-drop editing environment that allows for easy authoring and debugging of the XML. We then describe how this XML file is translated into a monitoring capability that automatically executes the appropriate functions to validate or invalidate the flight rule. Finally, we show examples from actual ISS telemetry of the real-time monitoring of this specific flight rule. A flight controller interface has been designed using the next generation of mission control tools to allow easy configuration, manipulation and supervision of flight rule monitoring. This flight controller interface will work in concert with the editor and execution engine to enhance the safety of space missions by automatically detecting flight rule violations. I.},

Semantic coordination, namely the problem of finding an agreement on the meaning of heterogeneous semantic models, is one of the key issues in the development of the Semantic Web. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for discovering semantic mappings across hierarchical classifications based on a new approach to semantic coordination. This approach shifts the problem of semantic coordination from the problem of computing linguistic or structural similarities (what most other proposed approaches do) to the problem of deducing relations between sets of logical formulae that represent the meaning of concepts belonging to different models. We show how to apply the approach and the algorithm to an interesting family of semantic models, namely hierarchical classifications, and present the results of preliminary tests on two types of hierarchical classifications, web directories and catalogs. Finally, we argue why this is a significant improvement on previous approaches. 1},

This paper will review accomplishments and challenges, citing some of the key research findings and publications that have resulted from the experiments in Biosphere 2. Engineering accomplishments included development of a technique for variable volume to deal with pressure differences between the facility and outside environment, developing methods of atmospheric leak detection and sealing, while achieving new standards of closure, with an annual atmospheric leakrate of less than 10% or less than 300 ppm per day. This degree of closure permitted detailed tracking of carbon dioxide oxygen and trice gases such as nitrous oxide and ethylene over the seasonal variability of two years. Full closure also necessitated developing new approaches and technologies for complete air, water and wastewater recycle and reuse within the facility. The development of a soil-based highly productive agricultural system was a first in closed ecological systems and much was learned about managing a wide variety of crops using non-chemical means of pest and disease control. Closed ecological systems have different temporal biogeochemical cycling and ranges of atmospheric components because of their smaller reservoirs of air, water and soil and higher concentration of biomass and provided detailed examination, Biosphere 2 and modeling of these accelerated cycles over a period of closure which measured in years. Medical research inside Biosphere 2 included the effects on humans of lowered oxygen: the discovery that human productivity can be maintained with good health with lowered atmospheric oxygen levels could lead to major economies on the design of space stations and planetary/lunar settlements. The improved health resulting from the calorie-restricted but nutrient dense Biosphere 2 diet was the first such scientifically controlled experiment with humans. The success of Biosphere 2 in creating a diversity of terrestrial and marine environments, from rainforest to coral reef, allowed detailed studies with comprehensive measurements such that the dynamics of these complex biomic systems are now better understood. The coral reef ecosystem the largest artificial reef ever built catalyzed methods of study now being applied to planetary coral reef systems. Restoration ecology advanced through the creation and study of the dynamics of adaptation and self-organization of the biomes in Biosphere 2. The international interest that Biosphere 2 generated has given new impetus to the public recognition of the sciences of biospheres (biospherics), biomes and closed ecological life systems. The facility, although no longer a materially-closed ecological system, is being used as an educational facility by Columbia University as an introduction to the study of the biosphere and complex system ecology and for carbon dioxide impacts utilizing the complex ecosystems created in Biosphere '.The many lessons learned from Biosphere 2 are being used by its key team of creators in their design and operation of a laboratory-sized closed ecological system, the Laboratory Biosphere, in operation as of March 2002 and for the design of a Mars on Earth{\texttrademark} prototype life support system for manned missions to Mars and surface habitats. Biosphere 2 is an important foundation for future advances in biospherics, Mars and closed ecological system research.},

  abstract      = {e-Science offers a promising vision of how computer and communication technology can support and enhance the scientific process. It does this by enabling scientists to generate, analyse, share and discuss their insights, experiments and results in an effective manner. The underlying computer infrastructure that provides these facilities is commonly referred to as the Grid. At this time, there are a number of grid applications being developed and there is a whole raft of computer technologies that provide fragments of the necessary functionality. However there is currently a major gap between these endeavours and the vision of e-Science in which there is a high degree of easy-to-use and seamless automation and in which there are flexible collaborations and computations on a global scale. To bridge this practice–aspiration divide, this paper presents a research agenda whose aim is to move from the current state of the art in e-Science infrastructure, to the future infrastructure that is needed to support the full richness of the e-Science vision. Here the future e-Science research infrastructure is termed the Semantic Grid (Semantic Grid to Grid is meant to connote a similar relationship to the one that exists between the Semantic Web and the Web). In particular, we present a conceptual architecture for the Semantic Grid. This architecture adopts a service-oriented perspective in which distinct stakeholders in the scientific process, represented as software agents, provide services to one another, under various service level agreements, in various forms of marketplace. We then focus predominantly on the issues concerned with the way that knowledge is acquired and used in such environments since we believe this is the key differentiator between current grid endeavours and those envisioned for the Semantic Grid. 1.},

  abstract  = {In May 2015, NASA’s BEAM (Bigelow Expandable Activity Module) mission will feature the robotic berthing of one of Bigelow Aerospace’s BEAM modules at one of the interfaces of the International Space Station’s (ISS) Tranquility node. As well as providing much-needed logistics and stowage support for the orbiting outpost, BEAM is expected to provide useful data on the performance of non-rigid space station modules. As discussed in the previous chapter, expandable space station modules are nothing new. But the TransHab discussed in Chapter 2 is not quite the same as the BEAM. While TransHab proved many of the aspects of inflatable module technology, there was still much work to be done. For example, although the NASA team had begun working on how to incorporate windows, putting holes in the module walls complicated the engineering of the skin so much that they left windows out of the proposed ISS module design entirely, although NASA filed a patent describing how windows could be fitted into a module. While details of how Bigelow has evolved the TransHab technology have not been published, one of the improvements was to include windows. To that end, Bigelow engineers conducted pressurization tests of different module designs, often deliberately pushing designs beyond their limits to establish safety margins. These tests often resulted in the module exploding. Fortunately, the team followed NASA’s experience by conducting the pressurization tests under water, which muted the explosive force when the modules ripped apart. In one test, engineers decided to conduct a fill-to-fail test in open air and discovered why NASA hadn’t when the test module exploded with such force that it shook the foundation of the building.

Global warming is partly due to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. In the last two decades, many investigations have studied the effect of high CO2 levels on crops. However, nearly all studies have examined the effects of CO2 enrichment up to about 1200 μmol mol−1. In general, more CO2 is beneficial to plant growth because plants feed on CO2. Here we tested the effect of CO2 levels from 400 to 5000 μmol mol−1 on the yield and antioxidant capacity of Chinese cabbage, Brassica chinensis, and lettuce, Lactuca sativa. Total antioxidant capacity was measured using the ferric ion reducing antioxidant potential assay and the diphenyl-picryl-hydrazylhydrate free radical detection. Our results show that, as expected, CO2 concentrations of 1000–3000 μmol mol−1 enhance the yields and contents of polyphenols, flavonoids and vitamin C in both vegetables. However, surprisingly, further increase up to 5000 μmol mol−1 CO2 decreased yields and contents of polyphenols, flavonoids and vitamin C. Our findings thus show that very high atmospheric CO2 levels are impeding the growth of tested plants. They also suggest that agricultural food and production could be depleted at high atmospheric CO2 levels.},

The requirements were identified by means of literature review as well as interviews to users and stakeholders. After an introduction to EVAs, the method followed for the design is presented. The space environment and the main characteristics of spacesuits and gloves are reviewed, focusing in particular on the condition of the hands. The fatigue problem of arms and hands during EVAs is explained and some peculiarities of the training that astronauts undergo to prepare to this type of activities in space are stressed. Since one of the most important problems for materials and electronics in space is radiation, the total dose that has to be withstood in the typical International Space Station (ISS) environment is then estimated. Different requirements also come from the EVA spacesuit equipment, as well as from safety and cost considerations. A discussion on kinematics and dynamics follows, in which the main hand movements needed for EVAs and the different joints of the fingers are discussed. Finally, a table summarizes the identified requirements, which drive the design of the hand exoskeleton.},

  abstract  = {Mars missions are fundamentally different from lunar missions. Use of the Moon would provide some risk reduction for Mars, but not in proportion to the investment required. ISRU on the Moon is vastly different than ISRU on Mars. Despite previous work, the feasibility and cost of human missions to Mars remains murky. DRM-1 and DRM-3 pointed the way toward Mars missions in the 1990s, but these were only preliminary studies. DRA-5 emerged around 2005 providing a broad analysis of many mission options, but only a brief summary was published. As of 2014–2015, NASA adopted the Evolvable Mars Campaign. The general approach involves developing “evolutionary capabilities” but it seems likely that the EMC is just another NASA boondoggle that is based on vague and ephemeral notions using glossy viewgraphs, and a total lack of detailed engineering calculations. It will end up being scrapped for good reasons, as NASA moves on to its next long-range plan. The critical advanced technologies needed to enable human missions to Mars include aerocapture and aero-assisted entry, descent and landing, long-term cryogenic propellant storage in space and on Mars, methane-oxygen propulsion systems, nuclear reactor for surface power, radiation protection, reduced gravity mitigation, long-term life support systems, and ISRU and/or the nuclear thermal rocket. Unfortunately, NASA’s track record for developing advanced technologies to a state of maturity sufficient for use in space missions is not very good. Long, sustained, expensive technology developments are rarely carried through by NASA to completion.},

Recent studies have established that the organizational structure of such communities is not flat; rather, participants can take on a variety of well-defined functional roles. What is the nature of functional roles? How have they evolved? And how do participants assume these functions? Prior studies focused primarily on participants' activities, rather than functional roles. Further, extant conceptualizations of role transitions in production communities, such as the Reader to Leader framework, emphasize a single dimension: organizational power, overlooking distinctions between functions. In contrast, in this paper we empirically study the nature and structure of functional roles within Wikipedia, seeking to validate existing theoretical frameworks. The analysis sheds new light on the nature of functional roles, revealing the intricate "career paths" resulting from participants' role transitions.},

This paper describes strong macroscopic regularities in how people contribute to peer production systems, and shows how these regularities arise from simple dynamical rules. First, it is demonstrated that the probability a person stops contributing varies inversely with the number of contributions he has made. This rule leads to a power law distribution for the number of contributions per person in which a small number of very active users make most of the contributions. The rule also implies that the power law exponent is proportional to the effort required to contribute, as justified by the data. Second, the level of activity per topic is shown to follow a lognormal distribution generated by a stochastic reinforcement mechanism. A small number of very popular topics thus accumulate the vast majority of contributions. These trends are demonstrated to hold across hundreds of millions of contributions to four disparate peer production systems of differing scope, interface style, and purpose.},

Using a recently introduced measure we showed that the editorial activities have intrinsic dependencies in the burstiness of events. A comparison of the English and Simple English WPs revealed important aspects of language complexity and showed how peer cooperation solved the task of enhancing readability. One of our focus issues was characterizing the conflicts or edit wars in WPs, which helped us to automatically filter out controversial pages. When studying the temporal evolution of the controversiality of such pages we identified typical patterns and classified conflicts accordingly. Our quantitative analysis provides the basis of modeling conflicts and their resolution in collaborative environments and contribute to the understanding of this issue, which becomes increasingly important with the development of information communication technology.},

But as this groundbreaking book demonstrates, what Muir was really seeing when he admired the grand vistas of Yosemite and the gold and purple flowers carpeting the Central Valley were the fertile gardens of the Sierra Miwok and Valley Yokuts Indians, modified and made productive by centuries of harvesting, tilling, sowing, pruning, and burning. Marvelously detailed and beautifully written, Tending the Wild is an unparalleled examination of Native American knowledge and uses of California's natural resources that reshapes our understanding of native cultures and shows how we might begin to use their knowledge in our own conservation efforts.     M. Kat Anderson presents a wealth of information on native land management practices gleaned in part from interviews and correspondence with Native Americans who recall what their grandparents told them about how and when areas were burned, which plants were eaten and which were used for basketry, and how plants were tended. The complex picture that emerges from this and other historical source material dispels the hunter-gatherer stereotype long perpetuated in anthropological and historical literature. We come to see California's indigenous people as active agents of environmental change and stewardship. Tending the Wild persuasively argues that this traditional ecological knowledge is essential if we are to successfully meet the challenge of living sustainably.},

It collects seven essays, originally published in a broad range of journals, and adds an extensive new introduction to the collection, along with new prefaces to each essay and a useful new appendix of additional resources. Written in Axelrod's acclaimed, accessible style, this collection serves as an introductory text on complexity theory and computer modeling in the social sciences and as an overview of the current state of the art in the field.The articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's Dilemma to study a rich set of issues, including how to cope with errors in perception or implementation, how norms emerge, and how new political actors and regions of shared culture can develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of interaction between individuals and uses computer simulation to discover emergent properties of the social system.

For many decades, autism has been viewed as a biomedical condition, highlighting deficits in social interaction and communication. Based on ethnographic data from a study of adults with High Functioning Autism, this article explores the emergence of the autistic community, a group composed of people with autism, who are challenging these notions. First, I suggest that three historical trends can be linked to the emergence of this community: the widening of the autism spectrum, the strengthening of the self-advocacy movement, and the explosion of technology. Drawing from ethnographic data, I describe the community, including its discourse, occupations or activities, and lexicon. Although the autistic community has grown over the past decade, it has also faced resistance from both inside and outside the group. I investigate this tension, arising in a debate regarding whether autism is a condition in need of a cure or a way of life and suggest that the autistic community has the power to transform notions of autism. Implications of this research for psychological anthropology's notions of sociality are introduced. [autism, community, social model of disability, occupation]},

The phenomenon he describes as social production is reshaping markets, while at the same time offering new opportunities to enhance individual freedom, cultural diversity, political discourse, and justice. But these results are by no means inevitable: a systematic campaign to protect the entrenched industrial information economy of the last century threatens the promise of today’s emerging networked information environment.In this comprehensive social theory of the Internet and the networked information economy, Benkler describes how patterns of information, knowledge, and cultural production are changing—and shows that the way information and knowledge are made available can either limit or enlarge the ways people can create and express themselves. He describes the range of legal and policy choices that confront us and maintains that there is much to be gained—or lost—by the decisions we make today.},

  abstract      = {What do Wikipedia, Zip Car’s business model, Barack Obama's presidential campaign, and a small group of lobster fishermen have in common? They all show the power and promise of human cooperation in transforming our businesses, our government, and our society at large. Because today, when the costs of collaborating are lower than ever before, there are no limits to what we can achieve by working together.For centuries, we as a society have operated according to a very unflattering view of human nature:  that, humans are universally and inherently selfish creatures. As a result, our most deeply entrenched social structures – our top-down business models, our punitive legal systems, our market-based approaches to everything from education reform to environmental regulation - have been built on the premise that humans are driven only by self interest, programmed to respond only to the invisible hand of the free markets or the iron fist of a controlling government. In the last decade, however, this fallacy has finally begun to unravel, as hundreds of studies conducted across dozens of cultures have found that most people will act far more cooperatively than previously believed.  Here, Harvard University Professor Yochai Benkler draws on cutting-edge findings from neuroscience, economics, sociology, evolutionary biology, political science, and a wealth of real world examples to debunk this long-held myth and reveal how we can harness the power of human cooperation to improve business processes, design smarter technology, reform our economic systems, maximize volunteer contributions to science, reduce crime, improve the efficacy of civic movements, and more.  For example, he describes how:    • By building on countless voluntary contributions, open-source software communities have developed some of the most important infrastructure on which the World Wide Web runs   • Experiments with pay-as-you-wish pricing in the music industry reveal that fans will voluntarily pay far more for their favorite music than economic models would ever predic   • Many self-regulating communities, from the lobster fishermen of Maine to farmers in Spain, live within self-regulating system for sharing and allocating communal resources   • Despite recent setbacks, Toyota’s collaborative shop-floor, supply chain, and management structure contributed to its meteoric rise above its American counterparts for over a quarter century.    • Police precincts across the nation have managed to reduce crime in tough neighborhoods through collaborative, trust-based, community partnerships. A must-read for anyone who wants to understand the dynamics of cooperation in 21st century life, The Penguin and the Leviathan not only challenges so many of the ways in which we live and work, it forces us to rethink our entire view of human nature.},

The book Modeling and Simulation uses exactly the same approach except that the traditional mental model is translated into a computer model, and the simulations of alternative outcomes under varying conditions are programmed on the computer. The advantage of this method is that the computer can track the multitude of implications and consequences in complex relationships much more quickly and reliably than the human mind. This unique interdisciplinary text not only provides a self contained and complete guide to the methods and mathematical background of modeling and simulation software ({SIMPAS}) and a collection of 50 systems models on an accompanying diskette.

  abstract      = {In this paper we explore the significance of metaphor and dominant cultural narratives in current autism discourse. We briefly explore the history of metaphor in autism discourse, and outline the contemporary struggle between the culturally dominant metaphor of autism as disease and the emergent counter‐narrative of autism within neurodiversity. We argue that metaphor serves very specific purposes in autism discourse, including (1) to create a commonsensical narrative congruence between common understandings of autism and currently dominant notions about its aetiology(ies) or causes(s), and (2) to create a commonsensical narrative congruence between common understandings of autism and currently dominant notions about appropriate responses to or interventions for autism. We argue that the bulk of the support for metaphorically framing autism within a disease model comes from within the non‐autistic (‘neurotypical’ or ‘{NT}’) community, whereas the bulk of the support for metaphorically framing autism within a neurodiversity model comes from within the autistic community (and is inclusive of some non‐autistic allies as well). In exploring these competing cultural narratives, we argue for the crucial import that counter‐narrative can play in the process of cultural critique and resistance to ideological hegemony.},

Interest in social simulation has been growing rapidly worldwide  as a result of increasingly powerful  hardware capabilities and software programs.  The focus on this area of expertise is also influenced by a rising interest in the application of ideas of complexity, evolution, adaptation, and chaos in the social  sciences. This authoritative book details all of the common approaches to social simulation, to provide social scientists with an appreciation of the literature and allow those with some programming skills to create their own simulations. New for this edition are a chapter on how to use simulation as a tool, as well as a chapter on multi-agent systems to explain why and how multi-agent modeling has become the preferred approach to  simulation.},

In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative study focused on uncovering design guidelines for interactive visual supports that would address the many challenges inherent to current tools and practices. We present three prototype systems that address these design challenges with the use of large group displays, mobile personal devices, and personal recording technologies. We also describe the interventions associated with these prototypes along with the results from two focus group discussions around the interventions. We present further design guidance for visual supports and discuss tensions inherent to their design.},

The scientific problems within present linguistics, the book contends, combine with social problems of the society in which linguists participate to press linguistics to discover ethnographic foundations. The work of providing such foundations largely remains to be done. Working out the implications of these three principles requires a new mode of description of linguistic features and relationships, a mode which can treat the verbal means of a community as a part of its organization of communicative means.In Part One, Dell Hymes indicates the place of linguistic inquiry as part of an inquiry into communicable conduct in general. Part Two demonstrates the mutual relation between linguistics and other disciplines that contribute to the common larger field—sociology, social anthropology, education, folklore, and poetics are discussed. In Part Three the author argues that problems within linguistic inquiry suggest social foundations of linguistics deeper than presently assumed, such that social meaning and stylistic function must be taken into account systematically, and social life seen as a source of the organization of linguistic means.},

The current study investigated differences in the content, number, and specificity of the special interests held by adult individuals with autism spectrum disorder and neurotypical individuals, using Internet discussion forums as a data source. Quantitative analysis of forum posts revealed significant differences between the diagnostic groups. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder reported having more interests in systemizing domains, more specific interests, and a greater number of interests overall than neurotypical individuals.

Wells's proposal for a  World Brain. Both these projects, like Wikipedia, were fuelled by new technology -- which at the time included index cards and microfilm. What distinguishes Wikipedia from these and other more recent ventures is Wikipedia's good-faith collaborative culture, as seen not only in the writing and editing of articles but also in their discussion pages and edit histories. Keeping an open perspective on both knowledge claims and other contributors, Reagle argues, creates an extraordinary collaborative potential.  Wikipedia's style of collaborative production has been imitated, analyzed, and satirized. Despite the social unease over its implications for individual autonomy, institutional authority, and the character (and quality) of cultural products, Wikipedia's good-faith collaborative culture has brought us closer than ever to a realization of the century-old pursuit of a universal encyclopedia.},

  abstract      = {The captivating, all-but-forgotten story of Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and the search for a planet that never existed For more than fifty years, the world’s top scientists searched for the “missing” planet Vulcan, whose existence was mandated by Isaac Newton’s theories of gravity. Countless hours were spent on the hunt for the elusive orb, and some of the era’s most skilled astronomers even claimed to have found it. There was just one problem: It was never there. In The Hunt for Vulcan, Thomas Levenson follows the visionary scientists who inhabit the story of the phantom planet, starting with Isaac Newton, who in 1687 provided an explanation for all matter in motion throughout the universe, leading to Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier, who almost two centuries later built on Newton’s theories and discovered Neptune, becoming the most famous scientist in the world. Le Verrier attempted to surpass that triumph by predicting the existence of yet another planet in our solar system, Vulcan. It took Albert Einstein to discern that the mystery of the missing planet was a problem not of measurements or math but of Newton’s theory of gravity itself. Einstein’s general theory of relativity proved that Vulcan did not and could not exist, and that the search for it had merely been a quirk of operating under the wrong set of assumptions about the universe. Levenson tells the previously untold tale of how the “discovery” of Vulcan in the nineteenth century set the stage for Einstein’s monumental breakthrough, the greatest individual intellectual achievement of the twentieth century. A dramatic human story of an epic quest, The Hunt for Vulcan offers insight into how science really advances (as opposed to the way we’re taught about it in school) and how the best work of the greatest scientists reveals an artist’s sensibility. Opening a new window onto our world, Levenson illuminates some of our most iconic ideas as he recounts one of the strangest episodes in the history of science. Praise for The Hunt for Vulcan “Delightful . . . a charming tale about an all-but-forgotten episode in science history.”—The Wall Street Journal “Engaging . . . At heart, this is a story about how science advances, one insight at a time.

Lima presents two hundred intricately detailed tree diagram illustrations on a remarkable variety of subjects—from some of the earliest known examples from ancient Mesopotamia to the manuscripts of medieval monasteries to contributions by leading contemporary designers. A timeline of capsule biographies on key figures in the development of the tree diagram rounds out this one-of-a-kind visual compendium.},

It provides a detailed introduction to concepts such as emergence, self-organized criticality, automata, networks, diversity, adaptation, and feedback. It also demonstrates how complex adaptive systems can be explored using methods ranging from mathematics to computational models of adaptive agents. John Miller and Scott Page show how to combine ideas from economics, political science, biology, physics, and computer science to illuminate topics in organization, adaptation, decentralization, and robustness. They also demonstrate how the usual extremes used in modeling can be fruitfully transcended.},

In fact, they are often associated with a number of strengths.

A lifelong disability, or a naturally occurring form of cognitive difference akin to certain forms of genius? In truth, it is all of these things and more—and the future of our society depends on our understanding it. {WIRED} reporter Steve Silberman unearths the secret history of autism, long suppressed by the same clinicians who became famous for discovering it, and finds surprising answers to the crucial question of why the number of diagnoses has soared in recent years.   Going back to the earliest days of autism research and chronicling the brave and lonely journey of autistic people and their families through the decades, Silberman provides long-sought solutions to the autism puzzle, while mapping out a path for our society toward a more humane world in which people with learning differences and those who love them have access to the resources they need to live happier, healthier, more secure, and more meaningful lives.   Along the way, he reveals the untold story of Hans Asperger, the father of Asperger’s syndrome, whose “little professors” were targeted by the darkest social-engineering experiment in human history; exposes the covert campaign by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner to suppress knowledge of the autism spectrum for fifty years; and casts light on the growing movement of "neurodiversity" activists seeking respect, support, technological innovation, accommodations in the workplace and in education, and the right to self-determination for those with cognitive differences.},

  abstract = {Multilingualism is common offline, but we have a more limited understanding of the ways multilingualism is displayed online and the roles that multilinguals play in the spread of content between speakers of different languages. We take a computational approach to studying multilingualism using one of the largest user-generated content platforms, Wikipedia. We study multilingualism by collecting and analyzing a large dataset of the content written by multilingual editors of the English, German, and Spanish editions of Wikipedia. This dataset contains over two million paragraphs edited by over 15,000 multilingual users from July 8 to August 9, 2013. We analyze these multilingual editors in terms of their engagement, interests, and language proficiency in their primary and non-primary (secondary) languages and find that the English edition of Wikipedia displays different dynamics from the Spanish and German editions. Users primarily editing the Spanish and German editions make more complex edits than users who edit these editions as a second language. In contrast, users editing the English edition as a second language make edits that are just as complex as the edits by users who primarily edit the English edition. In this way, English serves a special role bringing together content written by multilinguals from many language editions. Nonetheless, language remains a formidable hurdle to the spread of content: we find evidence for a complexity barrier whereby editors are less likely to edit complex content in a second language. In addition, we find that multilinguals are less engaged and show lower levels of language proficiency in their second languages. We also examine the topical interests of multilingual editors and find that there is no significant difference between primary and non-primary editors in each language.},

	existing literature and views regarding interdisciplinarity, to discuss
	themes and components of such work, and to propose a theoretically
	based definition of interdisciplinary research. DATA SOURCES/STUDY
	SETTING: Two major data sources were used: interviews with researchers
	from various disciplines, and a systematic review of the education,
	business, and health care literature from January 1980 through January
	2005. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of literature, one-on-one interviews,
	field test (survey). DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: We reviewed
	14 definitions of interdisciplinarity, the characteristics of 42
	interdisciplinary research publications from multiple fields of study,
	and 14 researcher interviews to arrive at a preliminary definition
	of interdisciplinary research. That definition was then field tested
	by 12 individuals with interdisciplinary research experience, and
	their responses incorporated into the definition of interdisciplinary
	research proposed in this paper. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three key definitional
	characteristics were identified: the qualitative mode of research
	(and its theoretical underpinnings), existence of a continuum of
	synthesis among disciplines, and the desired outcome of the interdisciplinary
	research. CONCLUSION: Existing literature from several fields did
	not provide a definition for interdisciplinary research of sufficient
	specificity to facilitate activities such as identification of the
	competencies, structure, and resources needed for health care and
	health policy research. This analysis led to the proposed definition,
	which is designed to aid decision makers in funding agencies/program
	committees and researchers to identify and take full advantage the
	interdisciplinary approach, and to serve as a basis for competency-based
	formalized training to provide researchers with interdisciplinary
	skills.},

	When chondrocytes are duplicated in vitro, it is imperative to obtain
	an adequate number of cells of optimal phenotype. A temperature-sensitive
	polymer gel, a copolymer of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) and acrylic
	acid (PNiPAAm-co-Aac), has the ability of gelling at 37 degrees C
	(the lower critical solution temperature, LCST) or above and liquefying
	below that temperature (Vernon and Gutowska, Macromol. Symp. 1996;109:155-167).
	The hypothesis of this study was that chondrocytes could (1) duplicate
	in the copolymer gel; (2) regain their chondrocyte phenotype; and
	(3) be easily recovered from the gel by simply lowering the temperature
	below 37 degrees C. Chondrocytes from adult rabbit scapular cartilage
	were harvested and cultured in a monolayer culture until confluency
	(approximately 2 weeks). Next, the cells were harvested and seeded
	into the copolymer gel and cultured for 2-4 weeks. The phenotype
	of the cultured cells was then characterized. Two groups of control
	cultures, monolayer and agarose gel, were used to compare their ability
	to maintain chondrocyte phenotype. The results showed that chondrocytes
	isolated from rabbit scapula can re-express chondrocyte phenotype
	in agarose culture and polymer gel culture but not in monolayer culture.
	Also, cultured chondrocytes can be easily recovered from polymer
	gel culture by simply lowering the temperature. This new in vitro
	method of chondrocyte culture is recommended for chondrocyte propagation
	and regaining chondrocyte phenotype before cell seeding or transplantation.},

  abstract    = {Through their specificity and affinity, antibodies are useful tools
	in research and medicine. In this study, we investigated a new type
	of chromatographic method using a thermosensitive polymer for the
	purification of antibodies against a dextran derivative (DD), as
	a model. The thermally reversible soluble-insoluble poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-dextran
	derivative conjugate, named poly(NIPAAm)-DD, has been synthesized
	by conjugating amino-terminated poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) to a
	DD via ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide. On one hand,
	this report describes the two steps of poly(NIPAAm)-DD conjugation
	and characterization. On the other hand, the poly(NIPAAm)-DD conjugate
	was used as a tool to purify polyclonal antibodies in serum samples
	from rabbits subcutaneously immunized with the derivatized dextran.
	Antibodies were purified and quantified by immunoenzymatic assays.
	Our results indicate that antibodies recognized both DD and poly(NIPAAm)-DD.
	In contrast, they did not bind to native poly(NIPAAm) or poly(NIPAAm)
	conjugated with another anionic dextran. We conclude that the conjugation
	of a polysaccharide to poly(NIPAAm) leads to an original and efficient
	chromatographic method to purify antibodies. Moreover, this novel
	method of purification is rapid, sensitive, inexpensive and could
	be used to purify various types of antibodies.},

	swelling kinetics of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) gel (NiPAAm gel)
	was determined by monitoring the swelling process using a stereo

	could conveniently be studied after a temperature change. The results

	in which the swelling and shrinking of a gel is described as a motion
	of the gel network according to the diffusion equation. This was
	shown to be valid when the temperature changes are kept below the
	critical point of the gel. However, the model fails to describe the
	shrinking process when passing from below to above the critical temperature.
	The collective diffusion coefficient (D), defined as the osmotic
	bulk modulus divided by the friction factor, was determined by fitting
	to the experimental data. D was found to increase with temperature
	according to the Wilke-Chang relation D = 2.0.10(-11) + 7.6.10(-17).T/mu.

	critical solution temperature of the polymer, which is then separated
	from solution by increasing the temperature above the critical temperature.

  abstract  = {A pinched pressure-driven flow injection on a microchip is numerically
	simulated in order to optimize the relative values of the operational
	parameters. The geometry studied is a two-dimensional rectangular
	channel featuring a cross-junction with a large depth-over-width
	ratio. The hydrodynamic and convection-diffusion equations are solved
	for the two steps of the process: first, the sample solution is pinched
	into the transversal channel (injection channel), and then it is
	injected into the longitudinal one (separation channel), where the
	time evolution of the concentration is analyzed for different types
	of the detectors. Electroosmotic flow calculations have also been
	performed and have shown a good agreement with literature. The results
	for pressure-driven flow point out that the shape of the detection
	signal is strongly dependent on the velocity in the separation channel
	and on the position of the detection probes. The so-called double-humped
	peak, caused by the parabolic flow profile at high driving flow rate
	is analyzed. A tight pinch greatly decreases the amount of injected
	sample and, consequently, the signal sensitivity without increasing
	its quality. A proper pullback of the sample during the separation
	process can decrease the tailing due to the sample leakage from the
	injection channel. Although a high sample pullback causes a considerable
	decrease in the signal sensitivity, it also greatly enhances the
	peak resolution. Finally, it is shown that a wider injection channel
	with high sample pullback ensures an improved signal sensitivity
	with good resolution.},

	The first technique is based on the preparation of self-assembled
	monolayers of photocleavable organosilane and the second one on photoassisted
	grafting (365 nm) of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on a silicon
	or glass substrate. In the first case, we begin with monolayers carrying
	an o-nitrobenzyl function (hydrophobic area) that is photochemically
	cleaved, revealing a carboxylic acid group (hydrophilic area). The
	problem is that the energy necessary to cleave this monolayer is
	too high and the reaction time is more than 1 h with 50 mW/cm(2)
	irradiation flux. To overcome this practical disadvantage, we propose
	another approach that is based on the thiol-ene reaction with benzophenone
	as photoinitiator. In this approach, a monolayer of mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane
	(MPTS) is prepared first. Subsequently, a hydrocarbon chain is photografted
	locally onto the thiol layer, forming a hydrophobic surface while
	the reminding unmodified thiol surface is oxidized into sulfonic
	acid (hydrophilic area). We demonstrated the feasibility of this
	approach and synthesized high-quality self-assembled monolayers by
	UV grafting with an irradiation time of 30 s at 365 nm (50 mW/cm(2)).
	The modified surfaces have been characterized by contact angle measurements,
	X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), AFM, and multiple internal
	reflection infrared spectroscopy (MIR-FTIR). The difference in the
	contact angles on the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces reached
	a remarkable 77 degrees. We have also demonstrated that this method
	is compatible with selective surface grafting inside microfluidic
	channels.},

	behavior and through surface tension and adsorption measurements.
	In particular, the cloud points (CP) for pNIPAM in the presence of
	lidocaine and prilocaine under different conditions were compared
	to the effects of electrolytes and alcohols. It was found that the
	electrolytes affect the CP of pNIPAM in a lyotropic manner, whereas
	alcohols depress the CP of pNIPAM in an alkyl chain length dependent
	way; i.e., the longer the chain, the larger the decrease in CP. Lidocaine
	and prilocaine affect the CP of pNIPAM in a pH-dependent manner.
	Below the pK(a) of lidocaine and prilocaine, these cosolutes do not
	substantially affect the CP in the concentration range investigated,
	but rather behave analogous to simpler electrolytes. Above the pK(a),
	on the other hand, they strongly depress the CP already at low concentrations.
	In parallel, at low pH, the surface tension reduction due to lidocaine
	or prilocaine is marginal, whereas at high pH the surface tension
	is reduced considerably. Thus, the poor solubility of prilocaine
	and lidocaine at high pH causes these to become more surface active
	and simultaneously interact in a more pronounced way with pNIPAM.
	Furthermore, it was found from ellipsometry that an adsorbed pNIPAM
	layer contracts when lidocaine is added, presumably due to a lidocaine-pNIPAM
	interaction similar to that causing pNIPAM to phase separate. Analogous
	to this, it was demonstrated that an adsorbed pNIPAM layer shrinks
	and swells reversibly when the temperature is cycled above and beneath

	The polymerizations proceeded well with few side reactions. An increase
	in the content of 1 in the monomer feed appears to increase the number
	of branch chains, and at the same time no evidence was obtained for
	the presence of substituted acrylamide chain ends that may potentially
	result via elimination of the dithioate group. The polymer products
	show a clear tendency to increased molecular weight as the extent
	of conversion of monomer increases, while size exclusion chromatography
	(SEC) profiles indicate a complex distribution of molecular weights
	compared to linear polymers obtained with a non-RAFT carboxylate
	monomer. Both NMR and viscometry indicate that, as expected, increasing
	the amount of 1 in the feed has the effect of increasing the degree
	of branching in the final product. This increase in branching reduces
	the intrinsic viscosity of the solutions of the highly branched polymers
	compared to similar linear polymers. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
	displays a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in aqueous
	solutions, and cloud point data indicate a clear effect of chain
	architecture on the temperature at which this transition occurs.
	Thus, a set of linear analogous copolymers have LCST's that, for
	equivalent mole fractions of imidazole content, are higher than the

	(SOG) in-plane capacitive accelerometer. The accelerometer is a high
	aspect ratio structure with a 120 �m thick single-crystal silicon
	proof-mass and 3.4 �m sense gap, bonded to a glass substrate. It
	is fabricated using a simple 3-mask, 5-step process, and is fully
	CMOS compatible. A CMOS switched-capacitor readout circuit and an
	oversampled ?�? modulator are used to read out capacitance changes
	from the accelerometer. The CMOS chip is 2.6 � 2.4 mm� in size, utilizes
	chopper stabilization and correlated double sampling techniques,
	has a 106 dB open-loop dynamic range, a low input offset of 370 �V,
	and can resolve better than 20 aF. The accelerometer system has a
	measured sensitivity of 40 mV g^{-1} and input referred noise density
	of 79 �g Hz^{-1/2}. Using the SOG configuration, a post-CMOS monolithic
	integration technique is developed. The integration technique utilizes
	dielectric bridges, silicon islands and the SOG configuration to
	obtain a simple, robust and post-CMOS-compatible process. Utilizing
	this technique, an integrated SOG accelerometer has been fabricated
	using the University of Michigan 3 �m CMOS process.},

  abstract  = {A basic step in many biological assays is separating and isolating
	different types of cells from raw samples. To better meet these requirements
	in microfluidic devices for miniature biomedical analytical systems,
	an alternative method for separating cells has been devised by mimicking
	the physiological process of leukocyte recruitment to blood vessel
	walls: adhesive cell rolling and transient tethering. Reproducing
	these interactions for cells on surfaces of microstructured fluidic
	channels can serve to capture and concentrate cells and even to fractionate
	different cell types from a continuously flowing sample. To demonstrate
	this principle, two designs for microstructured fluidic channels
	were fabricated: an array of Square pillars and another with slender,
	Offset pillars. These structures were coated with E-selectin IgG
	chimera and the interactions of HL-60 and U-937 cells with these
	structures were characterized. With inflow of fluidic cell suspensions,
	the structures were able to efficiently capture and arrest cells
	directly from the rapid free stream flow. After capture, cells transit
	through the channel in three phases: cell rolling, cell tethering,
	and transient re-suspension in free stream flow before re-capture.
	Under these interactions, captured cells were enriched several hundred-fold
	from the original concentration. Additionally, among collected cells,
	the difference in flow-driven, adhesion-mediated cell transit in
	the Square design suggested that the two cell types could at least
	be partially fractionated.},

	and borosilicate glass wafers has been investigated. The effects
	of certain accelerated environmental tests such as thermal cycling;
	thermal shock and boiling test on bonding quality are evaluated.
	The bonding strength is measured using an in-house tensile tester
	and fracture mainly occurs inside the glass wafer other than along
	the interface, indicating the robustness of the bond. The experiments
	conducted show that fast cooling after bonding results in high thermal
	stress in glass, which deteriorated the mechanical performances.
	Thermal cycling and thermal shock can help relax thermal stress,
	while boiling does do harm to bonding strength owing to their different
	effect on microstructures. Finally, the fracture interfaces are examined
	and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).},

	used for a wide variety of biosensor and biomaterial applications.
	A thorough characterization of the surface properties of pNIPAM thin
	films will benefit those applications. In this work, we present analysis
	of a plasma-polymerized NIPAM (ppNIPAM) coating by multiple surface
	analytical techniques, including time-of-flight secondary-ion mass
	spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), contact angle measurement, atomic force
	microscopy (AFM), and sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational
	spectroscopy. ToF-SIMS data show that the plasma-deposited NIPAM
	polymer on the substrate is cross-linked with a good retention of
	the monomer integrity. Contact angle results confirm the thermoresponsive
	nature of the film as observed by a change of surface wettability
	as a function of temperature. Topographic and force-distance curve
	measurements by AFM further demonstrate that the grafted film shrinks
	or swells depending on the temperature of the aqueous environment.
	A clear transition of the elastic modulus is observed at 31-32 C.
	The change of the surface wettability and mechanical properties vs
	temperature are attributed to different conformations taken by the
	polymer, which is reflected on the outmost surface as distinct side
	chain groups orienting outward at different temperatures as measured
	by SFG. The results suggest that a ppNIPAM thin film on a substrate
	experiences similar mechanical and chemical changes to pNIPAM bulk
	polymers in solution. The SFG result provides evidence supporting
	the current theory of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST)
	behavior of pNIPAM.},

	studies of ELP delivery to human tumors implanted in nude mice demonstrated

	compared to the same polypeptide without hyperthermia. Similar results
	were also obtained for poly(NIPAAm) though the extent of accumulation
	was somewhat lesser than observed for the ELP. The endocytotic uptake
	of a thermally responsive ELP was also observed to be significantly
	enhanced by the thermally triggered phase transition of the polypeptide

	emphasized in health research, services, education and policy. The
	terms multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary
	are increasingly used in the literature, but are ambiguously defined
	and interchangeably used. This paper is the first of two in a series.
	It discusses the definitions, objectives, and evidence of effectiveness
	of such teamwork. METHODS: The paper is a literature review based
	on dictionaries, and Google and MEDLINE (1982-2006) searches. RESULTS:
	Multidisciplinarity draws on knowledge from different disciplines
	but stays within their boundaries. Interdisciplinarity analyzes,
	synthesizes and harmonizes links between disciplines into a coordinated
	and coherent whole. Transdisciplinarity integrates the natural, social
	and health sciences in a humanities context, and transcends their
	traditional boundaries. The objectives of multiple disciplinary approaches
	are to resolve real world or complex problems, to provide different
	perspectives on problems, to create comprehensive research questions,
	to develop concensus clinical definitions and guidelines, and to
	provide comprehensive health services. Multiple disciplinary teamwork
	has both benefits and drawbacks. CONCLUSION: The three terms refer
	to the involvement of multiple disciplines to varying degrees on
	the same continuum. The common words for multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary
	and transdisciplinary are additive, interactive, and holistic, respectively.
	With their own specific meanings, these terms should not be used
	interchangeably. The more general term "multiple disciplinary" is
	suggested for when the nature of involvement of multiple disciplines
	is unknown or unspecified. While multiple disciplinary teamwork is
	appropriate for complex problems, it is not always necessary in every
	single project.},

	triple-helix affinity precipitation is introduced for this purpose.
	A short, single-stranded oligonucleotide sequence (namely (CTT)7),
	which is capable of recognizing a complementary sequence in the double-stranded
	target (plasmid) DNA, is linked to a thermoresponsive N-isopropylacrylamide
	oligomer to form a so-called affinity macroligand (AML). At 4�C,
	i.e., below its critical solution temperature, the AML binds specifically
	to the target molecule in solution; by raising the temperature to
	40�C, i.e., beyond the critical solution temperature of the AML,
	the complex can be precipitated quantitatively. After redissolution
	of the complex at lower temperature, the target DNA can be released
	by a pH shift to slightly alkaline conditions (pH 9.0). Yields of
	highly pure (plasmid) DNA were routinely between 70% and 90%. Non-specific
	co- precipitation of either the target molecule by the non-activated
	AML precursor or of contaminants by the AML were below 7% and presumably
	due to physical entrapment of these molecules in the wet precipitate.
	Ligand efficiencies were at least 1 order of magnitude higher than
	in triple-helix affinity chromatography.},

	a van der Waals contact with biotin that is important in generating

	variations can be used as a substitute for temperature changes to
	make the polymer coating of compression-coated tablets soluble or

	control from delivery systems containing thermoresponsive polymers.
	The obtained results show the influence of the type and amount of

	time was only a few seconds. Ease of the integration was demonstrated
	by performing on chip serial dilutions of 2.8-folds, four times.

	capabilities. Experiments of particle dispensing by EWOD droplet
	handling are reported. Finally, work is shown concerning the coupling

	commercial Cytochrome C digest composed of 12 peptidic fragments
	whose isoelectric point values and hydrophobic character cover a

	peptidic fragments and their performances were seen to be similar
	as those of standard commercial columns dedicated to proteomic purposes
	with calculated separation efficiencies up to 145 x 10(3) plates/m.
	Monolithic LMA-based phases were then successfully polymerized in
	microchannels fabricated using the negative photoresist SU-8. After
	the polymerization, the systems were seen to withstand the pressures
	applied during the nanoLC-MS separation tests that were carried out
	in the same conditions as for the monolithic capillary columns. The
	pressure drop during these tests of the in-microchannel monoliths

	over PNIPA-modified surfaces when used as sorbents in temperature-sensitive
	chromatography. Yet, a full exploitation of these advantages requires
	a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the separation
	process. As a model system, we have studied the binding of three
	proteins (bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin, and lysozyme) to
	PNIPA microgels. Binding experiments were conducted both below (25�C)
	and above (37�C) the volume phase transition temperature of the gel,
	Tc. The analysis of the binding isotherms has shown that although
	an average gel particle contained a larger amount of protein below
	the phase transition temperature, the concentration of the protein
	within the particle was higher above this temperature. These findings
	were attributed to changes in the binding loci due to temperature
	swings around Tc: whereas a sorption mechanism is dominant below
	this temperature, surface-adsorption was more important above it.
	A comparison between the three studied proteins has shown that below
	Tc the binding increases with a decrease in the molecular weight.

	having the polar peptide group in the side-chain rather than in the
	backbone. It has been demonstrated experimentally that PNIPAM dissolved
	in aqueous solution undergoes a collapse transition from coil to
	globule on increasing temperature above the &theta;-point. By a careful
	reviewing of existing experimental data, we emphasize that such coil
	to globule collapse has to be considered an intramolecular first-order
	transition, analogous to the cold renaturation of small globular
	proteins. The main theoretical approaches to the coil to globule
	collapse in homopolymers are discussed briefly, and a critical comparison
	between the existing models is performed. We point out that, as a
	general result, the coil to globule collapse is expected to be a
	first-order transition for rigid and semi-rigid macromolecules. Finally,
	taking advantage of the analogy between the coil to globule collapse
	of PNIPAM and the cold renaturation of small globular proteins, we
	try to clarify some important and intriguing aspects of protein thermodynamics.
	This leads to the conclusion that the amphiphilic nature of polypeptide
	chain plays the fundamental role for the existence of two temperature-induced
	conformational transitions.},

	polymer blends were prepared and their application as heparin-releasing
	polymer coatings for the prevention of surface-induced thrombosis

	as heparin-releasing polymers is based on the unique temperature-dependent
	swelling of these materials. At room temperature, i.e., below the
	lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of poly (NiPAAm), the
	Biomer/(poly(NiPAAm) coatings are highly swollen. The high swelling
	enables fast loading of hydrophilic macromolecules (e.g., heparin)
	into the coating by a solution sorption technique. At a body temperature,
	i.e., above the LCST of poly (NiPAAm) the coatings are in a deswollen
	state and the absorbed macromolecules may be slowly released from
	a dense coating via a diffusion controlled mechanism. Biomer/poly(NiPAAm)
	coatings were obtained by blending and coprecipitation of the two
	linear polymers, Biomer and (poly(NiPAAm). The structure and water-swelling
	properties of the coatings were examined. Significant differences
	in water swelling at room temperature (RT) and 37 degrees C were
	observed as a result of the thermosensitivity of poly (NiPAAm). The
	surface structure of the coatings in dry and swollen states at RT
	and 37 degrees C was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Heparin
	was loaded into the coatings via a solution sorption at room temperature.
	Kinetic studies of heparin loading demonstrated that maximum loading
	was obtained within 1 h. The in vitro (37 degrees C) release profiles
	were characterized by a rapid initial release due to the squeezing
	effect of the collapsing polymer network, followed by a slower release
	phase controlled by heparin diffusion through the dense coating.
	The short-term antithrombogenicity of intravenous polyurethane catheters
	coated with heparin-releasing Biomer/poly(NiPAAm) thermosensitive
	coating was evaluated in a canine animal model. The results show
	that the heparin release from Biomer/poly(NiPAAm)-coated surfaces

	injected, steered, and deposited by means of optical tweezers in
	a poly(dimethylsiloxane) microfluidic device and consecutively lysed
	with SDS at a predefined position. Second, separation and detection
	of fluorescent dyes, amino acids, and proteins were achieved with
	LIF detection in the visible (VIS) (488 nm) as well as in the deep
	UV (266 nm) spectral range for label-free, native protein detection.
	Minute concentrations of 100 fM injected fluorescein could be detected
	in the VIS and a first protein separation and label-free detection
	could be achieved in the UV spectral range. Third, first analytical
	experiments with single Sf9 insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda)
	in a tailored microfluidic device exhibiting distinct electropherograms

  abstract    = {Copolymers of 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and N-isopropylacryl
	amide (NIPAAm) of various monomer ratios and molecular weights were
	evaluated as carrier systems for DNA delivery. All copolymers, even
	with a low DMAEMA content of 15 mol\%, were able to bind to DNA at
	25 degrees C. Light-scattering measurements indicate that complexation
	is accompanied by precipitation of the (co)polymer in the complex
	caused by a drop of the lower critical solution temperature of the
	(co)polymer. The (co)polymer/plasmid ratio at which complexes with
	a size of around 200 nm were formed increased with increasing NIPAAm
	content of the copolymer and was independent of molecular weight
	of the (co)polymer. However, complexes containing (co)polymers of
	low molecular weight or high NIPAAm content prepared at 25 degrees
	C aggregated rapidly when the temperature was raised to 37 degrees
	C, whereas complexes containing (co)polymers of high molecular weight
	or lower NIPAAm content were relatively stable at 37 degrees C. The
	zeta potential of the complexes was also independent of molecular
	weight of the (co)polymer and increased with increasing (co)polymer/plasmid
	ratio until a plateau value was reached. The (co)polymer/plasmid
	ratio at which this plateau was reached increased with increasing
	NIPAAm content. The plateau values decreased from around 26 mV to
	around 13 mV when the NIPAAm content of the copolymer was increased
	from 0 to 85 mol\%. The cytotoxicity of the complexes strongly decreased
	with increasing NIPAAm content and was independent of molecular weight
	of the (co)polymer. The transfection efficiency of complexes with
	poor stability was in general much lower than that of complexes with
	good stability. The transfection efficiency as a function of the
	(co)polymer/plasmid ratio showed a bell-shaped curve. The (co)polymer/plasmid
	ratio at which the transfection efficiency was maximal increased
	with increasing NIPAAm content, while the maximum transfection efficiency
	strongly decreased with increasing NIPAAm content of the copolymer.
	The results of this study show that the formation of stable (co)polymer/plasmid
	complexes with a size of around 200 nm is a prerequisite for efficient
	transfection. Furthermore, the transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity
	strongly decreased with decreasing zeta potential. Therefore, besides
	the size, the zeta potential can also be used as a characteristic
	to predict the behavior of this type of (co)polymer/plasmid complexes
	in transfection. Copolymers of DMAEMA and NIPAAm provided with a
	homing device may be interesting carrier systems for gene targeting
	because these copolymers can condense DNA to small particles, and
	the resulting complexes show a low cytotoxicity and aspecific transfection.},

	when they reversibly switch from a water-swollen to a deswollen state

	the pure PNIPAAm hydrogel. Dynamic mechanical analysis and tensile
	tests revealed that higher nanoparticle content generally produced
	improved hydrogel mechanical properties. Surfaces of nanocomposite
	hydrogels became increasingly more hydrophobic at all temperatures
	between 10 and 40 degrees C as the amount of hydrophobic polysiloxane

	surfaces as high-performance liquid chromatography media with aqueous
	mobile phases. Incorporation of hydrophobic sites is an important
	factor to improve the efficacy (selectivity and retention) of temperature-responsive
	chromatography. Toward this goal, we have synthesized semitelechelic
	copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide (IPAAm) and butyl methacrylate
	(BMA) having reactive terminal functional groups using telomerization.
	The lower critical solution temperatures of the copolymers shift
	to lower temperatures with increasing hydrophobic BMA content in
	the poly(IPAAm-co-BMA) relative to that of the IPAAm homopolymer.
	This temperature-responsive semitelechelic copolymer was grafted
	to the surface of (aminopropyl)silica through the reaction of activated
	ester-amine coupling. The polymer-modified silica was used as a column
	packing material. Separation of a mixture of five steroids having
	various hydrophobicities was investigated. Retention of steroids
	on poly(IPAAm-co-BMA)-modified columns is increased with an increase
	in column temperature. The capacity factors for steroids on the copolymer-modified
	silica beads was much larger than that on homopolymer PIPAAm-modified

	33.8 for poly(IPAAm-co-BMA) containing 5 mol\% BMA, while that for
	the PIPAAm homopolymer was 15.0 at the same temperature. The influence
	of column temperature on steroid retention behavior on copolymer-modified
	stationary phases was significant compared with the case of homopolymer-modified
	columns. Furthermore, retention times for steroids increased remarkably
	with increasing BMA composition. The temperature-responsive elution
	behavior for the steroids was strongly affected by the hydrophobicity
	of the grafted polymer chains on silica surfaces. Possible protein
	separation in temperature-responsive liquid chromatography was explored

  abstract  = {In this paper, the advantage of structuring catalytic reactors is
	discussed. In structured systems, the exact shape of all column internals
	is determined by design rather than chance. This results in two advantages
	for the engineer in charge of designing a reactor: (1) the structuring
	introduces additional characteristic length scales, leading to new
	degrees of freedom that allow decoupling of phenomena that otherwise
	would need a sub-optimal compromise and (2) full control over the
	entire geometry results in higher precision. Taking full control
	over the geometry boosts performance, especially if the catalyst
	is tailored to the reactor design.
	
	
	The monolith structure is the best-known example of a structured catalyst.
	We discuss the industrial benefits and practical pitfalls of this
	honeycomb of parallel capillaries that allows the advantages of microfluidics
	to be applied on an enormous scale. In this paper it is argued that
	the monolith is most suitable for processes that are (1) stable enough
	for packed-bed operation and (2) need better mass transfer than can
	be obtained in any conventional reactor, including the trickle bed
	and the stirred tank reactor. This includes several large-scale processes
	such as HDS. Fine chemical synthesis, where the objective of robust
	scale-up and predictability will never be met using stirred tanks,
	may equally benefit from the scalable ultra-high mass transfer that
	is obtained in monoliths.},

	(SMD): a plano-aspheric refractive lens for fluorescence excitation
	(illuminator) and a solid parabolic reflective mirror for fluorescence
	collection (collector). Although miniaturized in size, both optical
	components were produced and assembled onto the microfluidic device
	by readily manufacturable fabrication techniques. The optical resolution
	of the device is determined by the small and relatively low numerical
	aperture (NA) illuminator lens (0.10 effective NA, 4.0 mm diameter)
	that delivers excitation light to a diffraction limited 2.0 microm
	diameter spot at full width half maximum within the microfluidic
	channel. The collector (0.82 annular NA, 15 mm diameter) reflects
	the fluorescence over a large collection angle, representing 71\%
	of a hemisphere, toward a single photon counting module in an infinity-corrected
	scheme. As a proof-of-principle experiment for this simple integrated
	device, individual intercalated lambda-phage DNA molecules (48.5
	kb) were stretched in a mixed elongational-shear microflow, detected,
	and sized with a fluorescence signal to noise ratio of 9.9 +/-1.0.
	We have demonstrated that SMD does not require traditional high numerical
	aperture objective lenses and sub-micron positioning systems conventionally
	used in many applications. Rather, standard manufacturing processes
	can be combined in a novel way that promises greater accessibility
	and affordability for microfluidic-based single molecule applications.},

	of solid-phase extraction (SPE) of DNA and polymerase chain reaction
	(PCR) on a single chip. The chromatography required for SPE in the
	microfluidic sample preparation device (muSPD) was carried out in
	a silica bead/sol-gel SPE bed, where the purified DNA was eluted
	directly into a downstream chamber where conventional thermocycling
	allowed for PCR amplification of specific DNA target sequences. Through
	rapid, simple passivation of the PCR chamber with a silanizing reagent,
	reproducible DNA extraction and amplification was demonstrated from
	complex biological matrixes in a manner amenable to any research
	laboratory, using only a syringe pump and a conventional thermocycler.
	The muSPD allowed for SPE concentration of DNA from 600 nL of blood
	coupled to subsequent on-chip amplification that yielded a detectable
	amplicon; this simple device can be applied to a variety of routine
	genetic analyses without the need for sophisticated instrumentation.
	In addition, the applicability of these developments to nonconventional
	thermocycling was demonstrated through the use of noncontact, IR-mediated
	heating. This was exemplified with the isolation of DNA from an anthrax
	spore-spiked nasal swab and the subsequent on-chip amplification
	of target DNA sequences in a total processing time of only 25 min.},

	devices are expected to provide powerful tools not only to better

	but also for disease diagnosis. Such microfluidic devices for biomedical
	applications must be compatible with state-of-the-art flow measuring
	techniques, such as confocal microparticle image velocimetry (PIV).
	This confocal system has the ability to not only quantify flow patterns
	inside microchannels with high spatial and temporal resolution, but
	can also be used to obtain velocity measurements for several optically
	sectioned images along the depth of the microchannel. In this study,
	we investigated the ability to obtain velocity measurements using
	physiological saline (PS) and in vitro blood in a rectangular polydimethysiloxane
	(PDMS) microchannel (300 microm wide, 45 microm deep) using a confocal
	micro-PIV system. Applying this combination, measurements of trace
	particles seeded in the flow were performed for both fluids at a
	constant flow rate (Re = 0.02). Velocity profiles were acquired by
	successive measurements at different depth positions to obtain three-dimensional
	(3-D) information on the behavior of both fluid flows. Generally,
	the velocity profiles were found to be markedly blunt in the central
	region, mainly due to the low aspect ratio (h/w = 0.15) of the rectangular
	microchannel. Predictions using a theoretical model for the rectangular
	microchannel corresponded quite well with the experimental micro-PIV
	results for the PS fluid. However, for the in vitro blood with 20\%
	hematocrit, small fluctuations were found in the velocity profiles.
	The present study clearly shows that confocal micro-PIV can be effectively
	integrated with a PDMS microchannel and used to obtain blood velocity
	profiles along the full depth of the microchannel because of its
	unique 3-D optical sectioning ability. Advantages and disadvantages
	of PDMS microchannels over glass capillaries are also discussed.},

	from the best fit between the edge coordinates and the theoretical
	curve obtained from the Laplace equation. The contact angle is then
	obtained from the location of the air/solid interface and the best-fitted
	sessile drop profile. By controlling the humidity of air phase surrounding
	the drop, this technique can measure the advancing and receding contact
	angles and monitor the rate of advancing and receding of the three-phase
	line simultaneously. This technique works well on contact angle measurement
	for sessile drops with or without an equator. Preliminary studies
	on the dynamic contact angle have been made for water drops on paraffin,
	polymethylmethecrylate, and glass. The technique is capable of giving
	contact angle of 0.2° precision. ©1996 American Institute of Physics.},

	(N-isopropyl-acrylamide) (PNIPAAm) microgel beads was designed. The
	result indicates that the tack property of Eudragit E film increased
	with an increase of the PNIPAAm microgel beads added, but there was
	no significant difference between the dried PNIPAAm microgel beads
	with or without adsorbing drug. In addition, the peel strength of
	Eudragit E film initially decreased with the addition of PNIPAAm
	microgel beads, but increased to a maximum value when PNIPAAm microgel
	beads were added from 4\% to 7.6\%. then decreased again after 7.6\%.
	The optimal concentration of PNIPAAm microgel beads was 7.6\% (w/v)
	which had better tack and peel adhesive properties. The water uptake
	ratio of Eudragit E film containing PNIPAAm microgel beads was found
	to be temperature-dependent, suggesting that the Eudragit E film
	containing PNIPAAm microgel beads enabled to absorb the wound fluid.
	Eudragit E film containing PNIPAAm microgel beads with or without
	adsorbing drug had significantly reduced peel strength after 12 h-immersion
	in solution. All these results suggest that a novel drug-loaded wound

	with a shear elastic modulus due to one of the lowest glass transition

	The underlying physical principles of centrifugal pumping in microfluidic

	sample splitting, and separation, are introduced. Those fluidic functions

	of this centenary. These contributions can be classified into three
	basic areas: geodynamics, geological (planetary) catastrophism, and
	fluvial geomorphology. Regarding geodynamics, Einstein essentially
	supported Hapgood's very controversial theory called Earth Crust
	Displacement. With respect to geological (planetary) catastrophism,
	it is shown how the ideas of Einstein about Velikovsky's proposals
	evolved from 1946 to 1955. Finally, in relation to fluvial geodynamics,
	the review incorporates the elegant work in which Einstein explains
	the formation of meandering rivers. A general analysis of his contributions
	is also carried out from today's perspective. Given the interdisciplinarity
	and implications of Einstein's achievements to multiple fields of
	knowledge, we propose that the year 2005 serve, rather than to confine
	his universal figure within a specific scientific area, to broaden
	it for a better appreciation of this brilliant scientist in all of
	his dimensions.},

	A semitelechelic co-oligomer (IDc) was attached to trypsin by single-point

	trypsin using multipoint conjugation (PIDAAc-trypsin). Both conjugates

	as pure IDc, due to the highly mobile free polymer end group which
	remains sensitive to small temperature changes. The PIDAAc-trypsin
	conjugate precipitated at higher temperatures than pure PIDAAc, whose
	movement was restricted by multiple binding points. Enzyme stability
	in solution was improved after introduction of PIPAAm chains, which
	prevented autolysis attributed to conjugate steric hindrance. Stability
	under repeated temperature cycling was also dependent on the architecture

	we use a commercial imaging probe with sufficiently large diameter
	to encompass the entire device, enabling encoding of NMR information
	at any location on the chip. Because large-diameter coils are too

	magnetization and flow it into the outlet capillary. There, we detect
	the signal with optimal sensitivity, using a solenoidal microcoil,
	and reconstruct the information encoded in the fluid. We present
	a generally applicable design for a detection-only microcoil probe
	that can be inserted into the bore of a commercial imaging probe.

	Bioanalytical systems based on microfluidics, also called “lab-on-chips”
	or “micro Total Analysis Systems (microTAS), are still not very common,
	but they represent a very challenging and fast-developing area of
	research. They bear the promise of developing in the near future
	low cost, powerful and high throughput systems for biological and
	medical research, in strong synergy with the genomic revolution.
	They should also provide the basis for simple, low cost and user
	friendly ‘point of care’ devices, to help the application of the
	rapid progress of molecular biology and genomics in the fields of
	diagnosis and biotechnology. In the present review, we recall the
	biological and medical context in which this research takes place,
	and we provide a few examples of present challenges and trends, and
	of devices and technologies presently under development.},

	behavior of temperature sensitive LCST polymers on different substrates
	as a function of temperature. According to our studies with Poly
	64 (a copolymer of 60\% (mol) NIPAAm and 40\% (mol) NnBAAm, LCST
	= 8.5 degrees C in water), the copolymer retention depends on the
	rinse temperature. When the rinse temperature is above the LCST,
	the polymer adheres well to most surfaces. On the contrary, at rinse
	temperatures below the LCST, most of the adsorbed polymer is easily
	rinsed off. These studies are relevant to our work on the thermally
	reversible adsorption of LCST polymers conjugated to peptides and
	proteins, such as affinity ligands, for uses in immunoassays and
	affinity separations. The interaction between the LCST polymer and
	most hydrophobic polymer surfaces is mainly due to hydrophobic interactions,
	and the critical surface tension (gamma c) and the solubility parameter
	(delta) of the solid polymer substrate are the most important factors
	which influence the LCST polymer adsorption and retention. The critical
	surface tension appears to correlate best with the LCST polymer adsorption
	levels on different substrates, while the solubility parameter correlates
	best with the retention of the adsorbed polymer. According to our
	preliminary study, n-butyl groups probably interact more strongly
	with the substrates than isopropyl groups because of the greater
	hydrophobic surface area of the former groups.},

	developed to allow droplet passing over dried sample spots, making
	the process of in-line sample purification robust for parallel processing.
	As a result, parallel processing of multiple sample droplets is demonstrated
	on the integrated EWOD-MALDI-MS chip, an important step towards high-throughput
	MALDI-MS. The MS results, collected directly from the integrated

	similar results for coated copolymer films and standard tissue culture
	plastic controls. Deposition of CAPs on to the copolymer films was
	characterized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.
	Cell detachment from the copolymer films is not affected by the surface

	the electric double layer thickness is comparable to characteristic
	channel dimensions, and this results in nonuniform velocity profiles
	and strong electric fields transverse to the flow. In such channels,
	streamwise and transverse electromigration fluxes contribute to the
	separation and dispersion of analyte ions. In this paper, we report
	on analytical and numerical models for nanochannel electrophoretic
	transport and separation of neutral and charged analytes. We present
	continuum-based theoretical studies in nanoscale channels with characteristic
	depths on the order of the Debye length. Our model yields analytical
	expressions for electroosmotic flow, species transport velocity,
	streamwise-transverse concentration field distribution, and ratio
	of apparent electrophoretic mobility for a nanochannel to (standard)
	ion mobility. The model demonstrates that the effective mobility
	governing electrophoretic transport of charged species in nanochannels
	depends not only on electrolyte mobility values but also on potential,
	ion valence, and background electrolyte concentration. We also present
	a method we term electrokinetic separation by ion valence (EKSIV)
	whereby both ion valence and ion mobility may be determined independently
	from a comparison of micro- and nanoscale transport measurements.

	Polymeric beads were formed by dropping a polymer solution into an
	oil bath kept at a temperature above the lower critical solution
	temperature (LCST) of the polymer. The release profile of cytochrome
	c was investigated as a function of the polymer MW and pH of the
	release medium at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: The weight average MW ranged
	between 49,000 and 3 million. The LCST at pH 2.0 and pH 7.4 was 22
	degrees C and 60 degrees C respectively. SEM studies showed that
	the size of the pores decreased as the MW increased. Irrespective
	of MW, the polymeric beads did not swell or dissolve at pH 2.0 and
	37 degrees C and showed minimal drug release. At pH 7.4 and 37 degrees
	C, the rate of bead dissolution/swelling decreased as the MW of the
	polymer increased. CONCLUSIONS: By modulating polymer MW, it was
	possible to vary the physical properties of beads. Dissolution/swelling
	characteristics were dependent on the MW of the polymer. Such unique
	dissolution/swelling properties are useful for delivering drugs to

	molecular weight atactic and isotactic poly(NIPAM)s using both 1-phenylethyl

	the RAFT agents. The polymerization rate is about 16 times faster
	in the presence of the Lewis acid than that in the absence and 1.4
	times faster with PEPD than with CPDT as the RAFT agent. The polymer
	with a higher polydispersity was obtained when prepared in the presence
	of the Lewis acid than that in the absence. A longer induction period
	was observed using CPDT than PEPD. The chain-end structure of isotactic
	poly(NIPAM) was determined by 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
	The RAFT agent derived isotactic poly(NIPAM) was the main product
	as expected from the well-accepted mechanism of RAFT polymerization.
	Moreover, a series of stereoblock [atactic(a)-b-isotactic(i)] poly(NIPAM)
	with different block lengths were synthesized via a one-pot synthesis
	procedure: synthesis of the atactic block in the absence of the Lewis
	acid followed by the addition of the Lewis acid to synthesize the
	isotactic block. The longer is the isotactic block length, the higher
	is the meso dyad value of the stereoblock polymer as expected. We

	be responsible for this loss of function, and we have investigated
	novel isolation and passaging techniques which can alleviate this
	loss of retinoid metabolism. RPE cells were obtained from human donor

	trans -retinol. Retinoid metabolism was also measured in freshly
	isolated IPE, corneal endothelium (CE), an RPE cell line (D407),
	and two hepatocyte cell lines (Hepa 6 and HepG2). Membrane fractions
	from cells isolated nonenzymatically or using collagenase/hyaluronidase
	formed 11- cis -retinol, retinal isomers and retinyl esters. Retinoid
	metabolism of RPE cells freshly isolated by trypsinization showed
	no 11- cis -retinal and little 11- cis -retinol formation. Nondamaged

	confluent cultures dissociated into individual cells, but these cells
	showed poor retinoid metabolism, including no detectable retinyl

	using microfluidic devices for biochemical analysis and high-throughput

	at the liquid-liquid interface in a plug-based microfluidic system.
	The microfluidic system uses multiphase flows of immiscible fluorous
	and aqueous fluids to form plugs, which are aqueous droplets that
	are completely surrounded by fluorocarbon oil and do not come into
	direct contact with the hydrophobic surface of the microchannel.
	Protein adsorption at the aqueous-fluorous interface was controlled
	by using surfactants that were soluble in fluorocarbon oil but insoluble
	in aqueous solutions. Three perfluorinated alkane surfactants capped
	with different functional groups were used: a carboxylic acid, an
	alcohol, and a triethylene glycol group that was synthesized from
	commercially available materials. Using complementary methods of
	analysis, adsorption was characterized for several proteins (bovine
	serum albumin (BSA) and fibrinogen), including enzymes (ribonuclease
	A (RNase A) and alkaline phosphatase). These complementary methods
	involved characterizing adsorption in microliter-sized droplets by
	drop tensiometry and in nanoliter plugs by fluorescence microscopy
	and kinetic measurements of enzyme catalysis. The oligoethylene glycol-capped
	surfactant prevented protein adsorption in all cases. Adsorption
	of proteins to the carboxylic acid-capped surfactant in nanoliter
	plugs could be described by using the Langmuir model and tensiometry
	results for microliter drops. The microfluidic system was fabricated
	using rapid prototyping in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Black PDMS
	microfluidic devices, fabricated by curing a suspension of charcoal
	in PDMS, were used to measure the changes in fluorescence intensity
	more sensitively. This system will be useful for microfluidic bioassays,
	enzymatic kinetics, and protein crystallization, because it does
	not require surface modification during fabrication to control surface

	function such as an aldehyde for covalent attachment of an NH2-modified
	oligonucleotide or protein. The successive chemical steps are followed
	and quantified in terms of reaction efficiency. In these conditions,
	we could characterize the silica surface hydroxylation, the silanisation
	and the transformation of the epoxy final function into an aldehyde.
	Because process characterization shows that silanisation is the more
	critical step, an additional study is made about the type and quantity
	of Si�OH bonds present on the silica surface for various hydroxylation
	steps.
	
	
	This study demonstrates that MIR method using variable propagation
	distance is a powerful tool for process characterization and allows
	the optimisation of a reliable process for biochips.},

	deleterious to the electrical properties of silicon structures. Silicon
	wafers with metal�oxide semiconductor (MOS) capacitors were bonded
	to Corning 7740 (Pyrex) glass wafers. The concentration of mobile
	ions was measured on capacitors outside and within glass cavities
	using the triangular voltage sweep method. Using secondary ion mass
	spectrometry analysis, it was confirmed that the ions were sodium.
	We found an increase in sodium concentration Nm between 10^10 and
	10^13 cm-2, depending on the oxide location and the geometry of the
	glass cavity. The gate aluminium of the MOS capacitor was found to
	partly shield the oxide from contamination, causing a two to five
	times smaller increase in Nm. Reducing the bonding voltage from 800
	to 500 V did not affect the increase in Nm significantly. In contrast,
	changing the ambient in the bonding chamber from vacuum to 1020 mbar
	air, reduced the contamination of capacitors situated outside the
	glass. A plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposited Si3N4 film was
	found to be very beneficial in protecting the capacitors. The Si3N4
	prevented sodium contamination of the capacitors situated within
	the glass cavities, and radically reduced the contamination of the
	capacitors situated outside the glass. The results suggest that the
	contaminating sodium originated from the bulk glass.},

	A channel extends through the wafer from the tip of the nozzle to
	a reservoir etched into the opposite planar surface of the wafer.
	Nozzle diameters as small as 15 m have been fabricated using this
	method. The microfabricated electrospray device provides a reproducible,
	controllable, and robust means of producing nanoelectrospray of a
	liquid sample. The electrospray device was interfaced to an atmospheric
	pressure ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer using continuous
	infusion of test compounds at low nanoliter-per-minute flow rates.
	Nozzle-to-nozzle signal intensity reproducibility using 10 nozzles
	was demonstrated to be 12% with single-nozzle signal stability routinely
	less than 4% relative standard deviation (RSD). Solvent compositions
	have been electrosprayed ranging from 100% organic to 100% aqueous.
	The signal-to-noise ratio from the infusion of a 10 nM cytochrome

	nozzles were compared with pulled capillaries for overall sensitivity

	compared with that from a pulled capillary, and signal stability
	with the microchip was 2-4% RSD compared with 4-10% with a pulled
	capillary. Electrospray device lifetimes achieved thus far have exceeded
	8 h of continuous operation and should be sufficient for typical
	microfluidic applications. The total volume of the electrospray device
	is less than 25 pL, making it suitable for combination with microfluidic

	two levels: a single-chip level and a multiple-chip module (MCM)
	system level. At the individual chip level, a multilayer approach
	segregates components belonging to two fundamental categories: passive
	fluidic components (channels and reaction chambers) and active electromechanical
	control structures (sensors and actuators). This distinction is explicitly
	made to simplify the development process and minimize cost. Components
	belonging to these two categories are built separately on different
	physical layers and can communicate fluidically via cross-layer interconnects.
	The chip that hosts the electromechanical control structures is called
	the microfluidic breadboard (FBB). A single LOC module is constructed
	by attaching a chip comprised of a custom arrangement of fluid routing
	channels and reactors (passive chip) to the FBB. Many different LOC
	functions can be achieved by using different passive chips on an
	FBB with a standard resource configuration. Multiple modules can
	be interconnected to form a larger LOC system (MCM level). We demonstrated
	the utility of this architecture by developing systems for two separate

	cancer and another for detection of metal ions. In the first case,
	free prostate-specific antigen was detected at 500 aM concentration

	dish surfaces grafted with a temperature-responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide).
	Cells adhered and proliferated, forming confluent cardiac myocyte
	sheets in a fashion similar to those on ungrafted TCPS dishes. Decrease
	in culture temperature resulted in surface change of the polymer
	from slight hydrophobic to highly hydrophilic due to extensive hydration
	of the grafted polymer on the dishes. This results in release of
	cardiac myocyte sheets from the dishes without enzymatic or EDTA
	treatment. When no support was used, the detached cardiac myocyte
	sheets shrank to one-tenth size, which ceased their pulsation. When
	chitin membranes were used to support the confluent sheets to prevent
	cell shrinkage, the detached cell sheets could be transferred and
	readily adhered onto another virgin TCPS dishes. These transferred
	cell sheets preserved the similar cell morphology and pulsation to
	those before the detachment. When polyethylene meshes were used to
	support cell sheet transfer, detached cardiac myocyte sheets partially
	attached to the mesh threads. Then, the constructs were inverted
	and placed in another culture dish to prevent direct association
	to dish surfaces. Moreover, the cardiac myocyte sheets were reorganized
	to heart tissue-like structures by the unisotropic contraction orientated
	by the mesh threads, and the pulsatile amplitude increased more than
	10 times higher. This technique would bring about new insight in
	tissue engineering as well as cultured heart model.},

	Microfluidic systems hold similar promise for the large-scale automation

	reagent. While it is too early to tell whether such a vision will
	be realized, significant progress has been achieved, and various

	of fluids is presented, as parametrized by a series of dimensionless
	numbers expressing the relative importance of various physical phenomena.
	Specifically, this review explores the Reynolds number Re, addressing
	inertial effects; the P�clet number Pe, which concerns convective
	and diffusive transport; the capillary number Ca expressing the importance
	of interfacial tension; the Deborah, Weissenberg, and elasticity
	numbers De, Wi, and El, describing elastic effects due to deformable
	microstructural elements like polymers; the Grashof and Rayleigh
	numbers Gr and Ra, describing density-driven flows; and the Knudsen
	number, describing the importance of noncontinuum molecular effects.
	Furthermore, the long-range nature of viscous flows and the small
	device dimensions inherent in microfluidics mean that the influence
	of boundaries is typically significant. A variety of strategies have
	been developed to manipulate fluids by exploiting boundary effects;
	among these are electrokinetic effects, acoustic streaming, and fluid-structure

	such as lack of electric charge and deficiency of a chromophore/fluorophore
	in analyte molecules, however, it benefits from the accumulated knowledge
	of capillary electrophoresis (CE) and rapid separation of simple
	sugars also by ME, with high column efficiency comparable to CE,
	has become possible. Analysis at high pH, with electrochemical detection,
	is a promising approach because carbohydrates can be ionized by weak
	dissociation of the hydroxyl groups and the in situ formed ionic
	species can be effectively separated by the zone electrophoresis
	mode. The separated species can be sensitively monitored by electrochemical
	detection on a gold or copper electrode. Ionization as borate complexes
	and refractometric detection is also possible, though sensitivity
	is lower. Introduction of UV-absorbing or fluorescent tags is potentially
	useful but the time-consuming derivatization processes sacrifice
	the rapidity of ME. Examples of ME of carbohydrates as 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone
	(PMP; for simple mono- and oligosaccharides with UV detection), 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate

	in a short separation channel enables rapid analysis within 1 min,
	it presents an ideal tool for clinical analysis, as shown in a few

	colourless, odourless and highly toxic phosphonate that acts as a
	cholinesterase inhibitor and disrupts neuromuscular transmission.
	Sarin and related phosphonates are chemical warfare agents, and there
	is a possibility of their application in a military or terrorist
	attack. This paper reports a lab-on-a-chip device for detecting a
	trace amount of sarin in a small volume of blood. The device should
	allow early detection of sarin exposure during medical triage to
	differentiate between those requiring medical treatment from mass
	psychogenic illness cases. The device is based on continuous-flow
	microfluidics with sequential stages for lysis of whole blood, regeneration
	of free nerve agent from its complex with blood cholinesterase, protein
	precipitation, filtration, enzyme-assisted reaction and optical detection.
	Whole blood was first mixed with a nerve gas regeneration agent,
	followed by a protein precipitation step. Subsequently, the lysed
	product was filtered on the chip in two steps to remove particulates
	and fluoride ions. The filtered blood sample was then tested for
	trace levels of regenerated sarin using immobilised cholinesterase
	on the chip. Activity of immobilised cholinesterase was monitored
	by the enzyme-assisted reaction of a substrate and reaction of the
	end-product with a chromophore. Resultant changes in chromophore-induced
	absorbance were recorded on the chip using a Z-shaped optical window.
	Loss of enzyme activity obtained prior and after passage of the treated
	blood sample, as shown by a decrease in recorded absorbance values,
	indicates the presence of either free or regenerated sarin in the
	blood sample. The device was fabricated in PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate)
	using CO(2)-laser micromachining. This paper reports the testing
	results of the different stages, as well as the whole device with
	all stages in the required assay sequence. The results demonstrate
	the potential use of a field-deployable hand-held device for point-of-care

  abstract  = {Background
	
	A critical step in the fabrication of biochips is the controlled placement
	of probes molecules on solid surfaces. This is currently performed
	by sequential deposition of probes on a target surface with split
	or solid pins. In this article, we present a cost-effective procedure
	namely microcontact printing using stamps, for a parallel deposition
	of probes applicable for manufacturing biochips.
	
	Results
	
	Contrary to a previous work, we showed that the stamps tailored with
	an elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) material did not require any
	surface modification to be able to adsorb oligonucleotides or PCR
	products. The adsorbed DNA molecules are subsequently printed efficiently
	on a target surface with high sub-micron resolution. Secondly, we
	showed that successive stamping is characterized by an exponential
	decay of the amount of transferred DNA molecules to the surface up
	the 4th print, then followed by a second regime of transfer that
	was dependent on the contact time and which resulted in reduced quality
	of the features. Thus, while consecutive stamping was possible, this
	procedure turned out to be less reproducible and more time consuming
	than simply re-inking the stamps between each print. Thirdly, we
	showed that the hybridization signals on arrays made by microcontact
	printing were 5 to 10-times higher than those made by conventional
	spotting methods. Finally, we demonstrated the validity of this microcontact
	printing method in manufacturing oligonucleotides arrays for mutations
	recognition in a yeast gene.
	
	Conclusion
	
	The microcontact printing can be considered as a new potential technology
	platform to pattern DNA microarrays that may have significant advantages
	over the conventional spotting technologies as it is easy to implement,
	it uses low cost material to make the stamp, and the arrays made
	by this technology are 10-times more sensitive in term of hybridization
	signals than those manufactured by conventional spotting technology.},

  abstract  = {The reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization
	of acrylamide (AM) was studied in order to establish reaction conditions
	which would provide optimal rates of monomer conversion and to determine
	reasons for deviation of theoretical and experimental molecular weights,
	the former predicted from current models. To this end, chain transfer
	agents (CTAs) and initiators were selected and experiments performed
	in water and in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at specified CTA/initiator
	ratios and temperatures. Higher apparent rates of polymerization
	were achieved utilizing CTAs with higher intermediate fragmentation
	rates, larger initiator concentrations, and higher temperatures.
	For RAFT polymerization of acrylamide under these experimental conditions,
	a continuing supply of radicals was required in order to achieve
	reasonable conversions. The deviations of experimentally measured
	molecular weights from those theoretically predicted are a function
	of the CTA utilized and parallel the extent of rate retardation.
	The deviations are, at least in part, consistent with significant
	early radical coupling of stable intermediate species during the
	preequilibrium period (or the recently proposed CTA �initialization�
	period). These effects are apparent in both aqueous buffer and DMSO.
	The retardation effects and eventual loss of linearity of the first-order
	kinetic plots at extended times are also consistent with termination
	processes although these experiments alone do not rule out alternative
	mechanisms of reversible termination or slow fragmentation of intermediate
	species. For RAFT polymerizations in DMSO mediated by the trithiocarbonate
	CTA, reaction rates are significantly faster, and near quantitative
	conversions can be reached with proper initiator choice.},

  abstract    = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic
	portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun
	sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated
	over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold
	coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from
	the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome
	assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining
	sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort.
	The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold
	coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without
	including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used
	by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage
	in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps
	in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold
	coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results
	that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies
	effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes.
	More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000
	bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million
	bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding
	transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and
	an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes
	with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense
	clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low
	G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence.
	Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in
	introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications
	of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are
	abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary
	history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions
	of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific
	developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems.
	DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly
	funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide
	polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed
	at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity
	in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of
	all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining
	which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

	substrate. A large channel, 800 microm wide, 150 microm deep and
	15 mm long, was created to act as a reactor bed for trypsin immobilized
	on 40-60 microm diameter beads. Separation was performed in channels
	etched 10 microm deep, 30 microm wide and about 45 mm long, feeding
	into a capillary, attached to the chip with a low dead volume coupling,
	that was 30 mm in length, with a 50 microm i.d. and 180 microm o.d.
	Sample was pumped through the reactor bed at flow rates between 0.5
	and 60 microL/min. The application of this device for rapid digestion,
	separation and identification of proteins is demonstrated for melittin,
	cytochrome c and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The rate and efficiency
	of digestion was related to the flow rate of the substrate solution
	through the reactor bed. A flow rate of 1 or 0.5 microL/min was found
	adequate for complete consumption of cytochrome c or BSA, corresponding
	to a digestion time of 3-6 min at room temperature. Coverage of the
	amino acid sequence ranged from 92\% for cytochrome c to 71\% for
	BSA, with some missed cleavages observed. Melittin was consumed within
	5 s. In contrast, a similar extent of digestion of melittin in a
	cuvet took 10-15 min. The kinetic limitations associated with the
	rapid digestion of low picomole levels of substrate were minimized
	using an integrated digestion bed with hydrodynamic flow to provide
	an increased ratio of trypsin to sample. This chip design thus provides
	a convenient platform for automated sample processing in proteomics

	anodic bonding process. To improve the bonding quality, a hydrogen-free
	amorphous silicon layer of about 40 nm thickness is deposited on
	the silicon wafer. Without applying the amorphous film, both the
	bond efficiency and the bond strength are low. With the assistance
	of the amorphous film, the bond quality is obviously improved. The
	bubble-free interface can be achieved as long as the temperature
	is above 250 �C. Even at lower temperatures, the unbonded area can
	be less than 0.5% of the wafer area. The bubble size decreases with
	an increase in the bonding temperature. A similar effect is observed
	with the applied voltage. The bond strength obtained is typically
	20 MPa or higher. In the destructive tests, fractures are found to
	occur mainly inside the glass wafer rather than at the interface.
	The interface is analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
	Raman spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The
	analyses show that Si---O chemical bonds are formed at the interface.
	Silicon oxidation and hydrogen bonding are the two main mechanisms
	that generate the bonding between silicon and glass wafers.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, anodic bonding between silicon wafer and glass wafer
	(Pyrex 7740) has been achieved at low temperature. The bond strength
	is measured using a tensile testing machine. The interfaces are examined
	and analyzed by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM), scanning electron
	microscopy (SEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The
	effects of the bonding parameters on bond quality are investigated
	using the Taguchi method. The bonding temperature used ranges from
	200 �C to 300 �C. Almost bubble-free interfaces have been obtained.
	The bonded area increases with increasing bonding temperature. The
	unbonded area is less than 1.5% within the whole wafer for bonding
	temperature between 200 �C and 300 �C. The bond strength is higher
	than 10 MPa and increases with the bonding temperature. Fracture
	mainly occurs inside the glass wafer other than in the interface
	when the bonding temperature is higher than 225 �C. Higher bonding
	temperature results in more oxygen migration to the interface and
	more Si�O bonds. The bonding mechanisms consist of hydrogen bonding
	and Si�O chemical reaction.},

	development of smaller, cheaper, and more precise biomedical instrumentation
	and devices. Little is known, however, about the hemocompatibility
	of the materials used to fabricate these devices. Because of the
	potentially harmful consequences of thrombus formation, a better
	understanding of blood interactions with bioMEMS materials is desirable.
	This study is an in vitro assessment of the hemocompatibility of
	silicon (Si), silicon dioxide (SiO2), silicon nitride (Si3N4), low-stress
	silicon nitride (Si(1.0)N(1.1)), SU-8 photoresist, and parylene thin
	films. A polycarbonate-based polyurethane, was used as a reference
	material. Experiments were carried out to detect differences in platelet
	adhesion or morphology after contact with these materials under static
	conditions. Platelet adhesion on Si, Si3N4, Si(1.0)N(1.1,) and SU-8
	photoresist was significantly greater (P < 0.05) than platelet adhesion
	on polyurethane. Adhesion on parylene and SiO(2) was not significantly
	different from on polyurethane (P < 0.05). The median platelet area
	and circularity were higher on polyurethane than all other materials.
	Materials that showed higher levels of platelet adhesion tended to
	have platelets that showed less spreading, except for SiO2, where
	platelets exhibited relatively low adhesion and spreading. This data
	suggests that Si, Si3N4, Si(1.0)N(1.1), and SU-8 photoresist may
	be more reactive to platelets and therefore more thrombogenic than
	parylene, SiO2, and polyurethane. These results may be helpful in
	guiding the selection of materials for use in the development of
	blood-contacting microelectromechanical systems.},

  abstract    = {An in-line sample purification method for MALDI-MS, which relies on
	the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD)-based technique for digital
	microfluidics, is reported. In this method, a droplet containing
	peptides and impurities is moved by EWOD and deposited onto a Teflon-AF
	surface. A droplet of water is subsequently moved over the spot,
	where it dissolves and removes the impurities. A droplet containing
	MALDI matrix is then moved to the spot, which is analyzed by MALDI-MS.
	This purification method reduces the number of salt adduct peaks
	caused by low concentrations of impurities (e.g., 20 mM sodium phosphate),
	and reduces or eliminates the catastrophic effects of high concentrations
	of impurities (e.g., 8 M urea). The method was used to purify spots
	made by depositing multiple droplets of contaminated peptides. Spectra
	from the purified spots showed an increase in the S/N ratio as a
	function of the number of droplets deposited; when not purified,
	the S/N ratio remained constant regardless of the number of droplets.
	Finally, the method was used to purify protein digests for peptide
	mass fragment (PMF) searches, and was shown to be more efficient
	than the conventional method of purification with reversed-phase-packed
	pipet tips. We anticipate this new, in-line sample purification technique
	for EWOD-MALDI-MS will enable development of integrated high-throughput

	also by polymerizing N-isopropylacrylamide monomers from the silicon
	surface ("method B"). Reflectivity data from the protonated layers
	in deuterated water were obtained using a liquid cell over a range
	of temperature from 10 to 55�C. For method A, PNIPAM molecular weights
	of 33K and 220K were examined. In D2O, we observed very limited change
	in the conformation of the tethered chains as the temperature increased
	through the LCST. No conformational change was detected for the lowest
	molecular weight PNIPAM-COOH sample (33K). Only a slight change in
	conformation with temperature was detected for the higher molecular
	weight sample (220K) and the sample from method B. The profiles indicated
	that the chains were well hydrated above 32�C, consistent with the
	observation of very low receding water contact angles. On the other
	hand, a significant change in the segment concentration profiles
	occurred when D2O was replaced by d-acetone. Bilayer profiles were
	observed for all samples in D2O. By contrast, in d-acetone the profiles
	were composed of a single monotonically decaying layer. Surprisingly,
	the profiles were more contracted in d-acetone than in D2O despite
	the fact that PNIPAM dissolves in d-acetone but solutions of PNIPAM
	in D2O are cloudy above the LCST. This observation, as well as the
	lack of conformational change with temperature for these low surface
	density brushes in D2O, is explained on the basis of a concentration-dependent
	Flory x parameter.},

  abstract  = {A method was developed to prepare thermosensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
	(PNIPAAm) hydrogels with an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN)
	structure for the purpose of improving its mechanical properties,
	response rate to temperature and sustained release of drugs. Although
	the differential scanning calorimetry data exhibited similarly lower
	critical solution temperature (LCST) between IPN- and non-IPN�PNIPAAm
	hydrogels, an increase in the glass transition temperature (Tg) of
	the IPNs relative to the normal PNIPAAm hydrogel was observed. In
	addition, the mechanical properties of the IPNs were greatly improved
	when compared with the normal PNIPAAm hydrogel. The interior morphology
	of the IPN�PNIPAAm hydrogels was revealed by scanning electron microscopy
	(SEM); the IPN hydrogels showed a fibrillar-like porous network structure
	that normal PNIPAAm did not have. Furthermore, by measuring the temperature
	dependence of the swelling ratio and deswelling kinetics, these IPN
	hydrogels also exhibited improved intelligent characteristics (e.g.,
	controllable faster response rate) that depended on the composition
	ratio of the two network components. From the applications viewpoint,
	the effects of a shrinking�reswelling cycle around the LCST on the
	properties of the IPN hydrogels were examined to determine if these
	properties would be stable for potential applications. Bovine serum
	albumin was chosen as the model protein for examining its release
	from the IPNs at different temperatures. The release data suggested
	that an improved controlled release could be achieved by the IPN�PNIPAAm
	hydrogels without losing their intelligent properties.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we present a mathematical model predicting combined
	electro-osmotic- and pressure-driven flow behavior in a straight
	microchannel for the case when the system is under a non-isothermal
	condition. The distribution of the charge density is governed by
	a nonlinear, two-dimensional Poisson�Boltzmann equation, and a body
	force caused by the interaction between the charge density and the
	applied electrical potential field is included in the full Navier�Stokes
	equations. Under non-isothermal conditions, arising from heat sources
	(Joule heating) within the system and/or a temperature difference
	between the system and the ambient, the equation of energy conservation
	describing temperature distribution has to be considered as well.
	The governing equations, interlinked via temperature, are solved
	numerically using a finite difference method. The numerical results
	indicate that for a given cross-sectional mean velocity, there exists
	an optimal dimensionless parameter (?h), which is the inverse Debye
	length multiplied by the channel size, which gives the highest hydraulic
	head generated by the electro-osmotic force. It has also been demonstrated
	that the pumping performance predicted by the isothermal model deviates
	substantially from that predicted by the non-isothermal model when
	Joule heating is significant.},

	Microfluidic Optical Fibers
	
	
	The blazing-fast Internet access of the future-imagine downloading
	movies in seconds-might just depend on a little plumbing in the network.
	Tiny droplets of fluid inside fiber-optic channels could improve
	the flow of data-carrying photons, speeding transmission and improving
	reliability. Realizing this radical idea is the goal of University
	of Illinois physicist John Rogers, whose prototype devices, called
	microfluidic optical fibers, may be the key to superfast delivery
	of everything from e-mail to Web-based computer programs, once "bandwidth"
	again becomes the mantra.
	
	
	Rogers began exploring fluid-filled fibers more than two years ago
	as a researcher at Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs. While the optical
	fibers that carry today's phone and data transmissions consist of
	glass tubing that is flexible but solid, Rogers employs fibers bored
	through with microscopic channels, ranging from one to 300 micrometers
	in diameter, depending on their use. While Rogers didn't invent the
	fibers, he and his team showed that pumping tiny amounts of various
	fluids into them-and then controlling the expansion, contraction,
	and movement of these liquid "plugs"-causes the optical properties
	of the fibers to change. Structures such as tiny heating coils printed
	directly on the fiber precisely control the size, shape, and position
	of the plugs. Modifying the plugs' properties enables them to perform
	critical functions, such as correcting error-causing distortions
	and directing data flows more efficiently, thus boosting bandwidth
	far more cheaply than is possible today.},

	The origin and signatures of the concentration dependent Flory $ chi
	_(eff)$-parameter for neutral water-soluble polymers are studied.
	The three versions of two-state model proposed previously to explain
	the phase behavior of Poly(ethylene oxide) in water lead to $ chi
	_(eff)( phi )$. This dependence can serve as a useful diagnostic
	of the performance of models: it allows to distinguish between different
	models and test involving parameters. The emergence of $ chi _(eff)(
	phi )$ from alternative single-state models is also discussed. The
	macroscopic signatures of $ chi _(eff)( phi )$ are illustrated on
	the example of swelling of isolated coils and planar brushes. The
	$ phi$ dependence of $ chi _(eff)$ in systems with uniform concentration
	gives rise to two main consequences: a shift in the crossover between
	Gaussian and self-avoidance regimes, and a possibility of a first-order
	collapse transition for isolated flexible coils. $ chi _(eff)( phi
	)$ can lead to a vertical phase separation in polymer brushes involving
	coexistence of two phases of finite concentration. This approach
	is applied to the interpretation of indirect evidence that Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
	brushes exhibit this effect.},

  abstract  = {Separation by size is a fundamental analytical and preparative technique
	in biology, medicine, chemistry, and industry. Fractionation of biological
	molecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins, plays a central role
	in genomic analysis. In the post-genomic era, this task becomes ever
	more important because solving the puzzle of interactions between
	proteins is far more complicated than deciphering genomes, due to
	the lack of proteins� equivalent of amplification, fractionation
	and sequencing techniques. 
	
	
	Micro- and nano-fabricated structures offer many possibilities to
	improve our abilityto manipulate and probe biological molecules.
	In this thesis, we first discuss howmicrofabricated Brownian ratchets
	are used for separation of molecules, including nucleic acids. More
	specifically, our contribution to this field includes clarifying
	the role of particle size in the ratchet array operations. Further,
	we improved by an order of magnitude the separation speed and resolution
	of such arrays, whose usefulness had been limited by the slow separation
	speed and poor resolution. The improvement is a result of flow tilting��adjusting
	the flow direction with respect to the array orientation.
	
	
	Related to flow tilting, we present a new method for particle separation
	according to size, with ultrahigh speed and resolution. The method
	uses an ordered array of obstacles and a driving flow, which is aligned
	at an angle with respect to the array. The flow undergoes series
	of uneven bifurcations at the obstacles. Particles in such a flow
	moves in one of the two distinct modes of migration, depending on
	their sizes. Submicrometer sized particles were separated with 1%
	resolution in 40 s. The physical mechanism of the separation process
	is presented.
	
	
	Although the tango array separates rigid particles with astonishingly
	high resolutions, its resolving power for DNA molecules is considerably
	lower, because DNA fragments coil in arbitrary shapes, and become
	stretched unequally when interacted with the tango array. A different
	microfluidic device for DNA separation, the DNA prism, is introduced.
	The DNA prism separates ~100 kb DNA 1000 times faster than conventional
	methods, and provides solutions to sample loading and field uniformity
	problems. A physical model for explaining the complicated separation
	characteristics of DNA prisms is developed. The model assumes that
	DNA molecules in such devices act as damped
	
	springs, which change their lengths in response to the applied electric
	pulses, instead of a rigid chain, as assumed in prior works. As a
	result of this model, conditions for improved separation characteristics
	are found.},

	de réaliser des puces à forte densité d'unités d'hybridation. L'éjection

	et sont actionnables individuellement. La structure retenue intègre
	une résistance chauffante sur une membrane diélectrique et une buse

	Un procédé technologique original a été mis au point pour intégrer
	le dispositif d’adressage à cette résistance. Il s’agit de diodes

	électriquement et thermiquement ; il a été ainsi montré que l’adressage

	l’éjection. Il a été montré que des gouttelettes de 0,1pl à 3nl pouvaient

	ABSTRACT : This thesis subject will be the design and production of
	a monolithic ejector array MEMS for the DNA chip in situ synthesis.
	The aim is to develop cheap, efficient and flexible systems, which
	allow localized deposit of reactive micro-drop ( nucleic acid in
	solution with acetonitrile) in order to synthesize the oligonucleotic
	sequences in situ. The advantages of such systems are a cheaper equipment,
	a larger flexibilty in the choice of synthesized sequences and the
	possibility of producing some chip with a high density of hybridization
	units. We select a thermal driver ejection. The principle is based
	on a thermal ink-jet but the originality comes from the ejectors
	which are located in an array with a large density and are individually
	driven. The selected structure integrates a heater resistor on a
	dielectric membrane and a Su8 photopolymerized nozzle. These specificities
	allow to localy reach temperatures which are high enough to generate
	the nucleation around the nozzle. An original technological process
	was made up to integrate the adressing device on this resistor: the
	diodes made in the polysilicon resistor. These diodes are obtained
	by diffusion and implantation of N and P zones. The threshold tension
	and the current leak of diodes were etablished according to the dopings
	used in order that only the selected microejector would heat. The
	achieved array was electrically and thermaly tested; it was found
	that the adressage system is active, the thermal power proposed is
	sufficient for the ejection. It was proved that some droplets (0,1pL
	to 3nL) can be ejected when the driver tension is of 25V and 5V and
	the electrical pulse of 50µs and 50ms.},

  abstract  = {This work concerns the general framework of molecular electronics.
	After the presentation of the stakes and the challenges, we describe
	the main achievements in this field.
	
	
	First, we made self-assembled monolayers on silicon by silanization.
	These monolayers with various thicknesses (8, 14 and 17 carbons)are
	functionalized by three chemical steps, with six different conjugated
	moieties at their ends. The structural characterizations (contact
	angle, ellipsometry, FTIR, AFM, X-ray diffraction) validate the realization
	of these structures. Thermal studies on these monolayers show thatthey
	are stable to temperatures up to 300�C. The electrical studies reveal
	that these structures behave as good insulators, and they exhibit
	a current rectification effect (molecular diode) with an average
	rectification ratio of 7 and 16 in best cases. This effect has been
	explained.
	
	
	Second, these functionalized monolayers were obtained in only one
	step by grafting specific molecules, which contain a grafting head
	and a conjugated moiety (thophene), separated by an alkyl chain (of
	8 and 13 carbons). The structural characterizations show that the
	conjugated moiety limits the film density, making it inhomogeneous.
	The electrical characteristics are consequently inhomogeneous and
	present parasit effects.
	
	
	The last structures, monolayers, monolayers made up with an alkyl
	chain (17 carbons), a conjugated moiety (4 phenyl derivatives were
	used) capped by another alkyl chain (7 and 18 carbons) were carried
	out in 3 and 5 chemical steps. The structural characterizations reveal
	a structure presenting a second alkyl monolayer almost as dense as
	the first one. The electrical characterizations demonstrate a small
	peak in the current voltage curves, typical of a resonant tunnel
	effet diode.},

	"Because technology provides the tools and biology the problems, the
	two should enjoy a happy marriage !"1 . Cette phrase resume parfaitement
	l'esprit du projet qui a motive ces travaux de these. En effet, le
	couplage des biotechnologies et des micro et nano technologies, resume
	sous le vocable "Nanobiotechnologies" est une activite en plein essor
	qui laisse presager de nombreuses applications en particulier dans
	le domaine de la biodetection. L'objectif principal de ces travaux
	est dedie au developpement de strategies d'adressage de biomolecules
	a l'echelle nanometrique pour des applications de biodetection. Le
	premier aspect de ce travail est d'ordre technologique. Il concerne
	la fabrication de dispositifs d'adressage bases sur des reseaux de
	nanoelectrodes planaires. En utilisant un procede reposant sur l'utilisation
	de la lithographie electronique haute resolution sur un microscope
	TEM/STEM, nous avons pu demontrer la fabrication de dispositifs a
	base de nanoelectrodes presentant des espaces inter-electrodes controlables
	entre 100 et 15nm. Une technique de lithographie alternative, la
	Nano-Impression est egalement presentee comme une solution possible
	a la replication de nanodispositifs fabriques par lithographie electronique.
	La deuxieme partie des travaux est dediee a la mise en place d'un
	schema de detection de nanoparticules que nous avons developpe autour
	de dispositifs bases sur des reseaux d'electrodes inter-digitees.
	Avant de nous interesser a l'utilisation de ces dispositifs pour
	une application biologique, nous avons etudie leur reponse electrique
	vis-a-vis de l'absorption de nanoparticules d'Or par interaction
	electrostatique. Les premiers resultats obtenus montrent que le schema
	de detection permet d'atteindre un niveau de sensibilite ultime au
	travers d'une mesure directe de la conductance des dispositifs. Certaines
	experiences montrent en effet la possibilite de mesurer electriquement
	l'adsorption d'une seule nanoparticule. Enfin, la derniere partie
	de ces travaux est dediee a l'adaptation de ce protocole pour la
	detection de biomolecules fonctionnalisees par des nanoparticules
	d'Or. Pour cela, nous avons employe une approche simple basee sur
	un systeme de reconnaissance entre une molecule cible et une molecule
	sonde. Ce schema a ete applique a la detection d'interaction antigene/anticorps
	et nous a permis de transcrire la selectivite de la reconnaissance
	entre les anticorps dans le depot des nanoparticules qui se traduit
	par une modification importante de la conductance du dispositif.
	Les possibilites d'integration ainsi que la compatibilite des dispositifs
	avec des systemes de microfluidique rendent ce schema de detection
	particulierement adapte pour le developpement d'un systeme integre
	de biodetection a tres haute sensibilite. 1 S. Fields, Proc. Natl.

	"Because technology provides the tools and biology the problems, the
	two should enjoy a happy marriage !" 1. This sentence perfectly summarizes
	the spirit of the project underling this thesis. Indeed, the so-called
	"Nanobiotechnologies", that couple Micro and Nanotechnologies with
	biotechnologies, is an emerging domain, potentially vector of many
	applications as for example in the field of biodetection. The main
	objective of this work is dedicated to the development of new strategies
	for addressing biomolecules at the nanometer scale for the development
	of biodetection applications. The first aspect of this work is technological.
	Using a planar process on silicon involving high-resolution electron
	beam lithography and lift-off, we have demonstrated the possible
	fabrication of nanoelectrodes based devices presenting gaps with
	controlled dimensions ranging from 100nm down to 15nm. An alternative
	method to electron beam lithography called NanoImprint Lithography
	is also presented as a possible way to replicate these devices. The
	second part is dedicated to the implementation of a nanosystem capable
	to detect metallic nanoparticles using interdigitated nanoelectrodes
	array based device. Before applying this procedure to a biodetection
	application, we have studied the electrical response of these devices
	versus the immobilization of gold nanoparticles on their active surface.
	The results indicate that the response is highly sensitive and that
	the detection of a single nanoparticle is possible using a direct
	conductance measurement. Finally, these devices were used to achieve
	the electrical detection of biomolecules labeled with gold nanoparticles.
	This approach was successfully applied to the electrical detection
	of antigene/antibody interactions. Combining this method with a conventional
	detection scheme based on the interaction between a target and a
	probe molecules, we have demonstrated that the selectivity of the
	biomolecular recognition can be revealed by the im mobilization of
	nanoparticles on the surface and finally translated into a drastic
	modification of the electrical transport through the device. The
	integration capacities and the compatibility of this detection schema
	with microfluidics open very interesting perspectives for the development
	of high sensitive integrated biochips. 1 S. Fields, Proc. Natl. Acad.

  abstract  = {There is a strong trend in fabricating miniaturized total analytical
	systems, µTAS, for various biochemical and cell biology applications.
	These miniaturized systems could e.g. gain better separation performances,
	be faster, consume less expensive reagents and be used for studies
	that are difficult to access in the macro world. Disposable µTAS
	eliminate the risk of carry-over and can be fabricated to a low cost.
	
	
	This work focused on the development of µTAS modules with the intentional
	use for miniaturized diagnostics. Modules for blood separation, desalting,
	enrichment, separation and ESI-MS detection were successfully fabricated.
	Surface coatings were additionally developed and evaluated for applications
	in µTAS with complex biological samples. The first heparin coating
	could be easily immobilized in a one-step-process, whereas the second
	heparin coating was aimed to form a hydrophilic surface that was
	able to draw blood or plasma samples into a microfluidic system by
	capillary forces. 
	
	
	The last mentioned heparin surface was further utilized when developing
	a chip-based sensor for performing CD4-count in human blood, an important
	marker to determine the stage of an HIV-infection.
	
	
	All devices in this work were fabricated in PDMS, an elastomeric polymer
	with the advantage of rapid and less expensive prototyping of the
	microfabricated master. It was shown that PDMS could be considered
	as the material of choice for future commercial µTAS. The devices
	were intentionally produced using a low grade of fabrication complexity.
	It was however demonstrated that even with low complexity, it is
	possible to integrate several functional chip modules into a single
