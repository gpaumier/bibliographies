Some of the aggregation was done by others, notably Tilman Bayer and Dario Taraborelli as part of their work on the [Wikimedia Research Newsletter](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Newsletter) and the [WikiResearch Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/wikiresearch). As far as I know, they have not asserted any copyright on that work.
